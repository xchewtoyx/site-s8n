Ode to my Love
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Pain, Sorrow, Heartache, Grief
| Joy, Ecstacy, Happiness : Love
| The feelings I have
| When I think of You

| In me you arouse
| My deepest desires
| To love you
| To hold you
| For you to be mine

| My heart it beats
| Like a thousand soldiers
| Marching away with my soul

| Whenever I'm near you
| My head feels light
| My knees feel weak
| And my sould feels strong

| My feelings mix
| 'Till my head it spins
| I've just go to have your love

| My mind is numb
| I feel so dumb
| Whenever we even exchange greetings
| I feel so strongly, yet cannot express
| The love I feel for you

Fun
^^^

| Poke him, taunt him
| Make him feel a fool
| He'll understand it must be done
| It's only harmless fun

| He loves her, he said so
| He sent her a card
| He thinks that he can have romance
| Of that there is no chance

| He is intelligent, but ugly
| Both ugly and fat
| Give him sorrow, never joy
| For he is just an ugly fat boy

| To me he is a nothing
| He has no feelings or pride
| He is sad, that's how he should be
| Because he is different from me

Life
^^^^

| Life is a void
| A deep all encompassing blackness, empty of all emotion<br>
| Pinpricks of hope dot this bleakest of landscapes<br>
| Like stars in a clear night sky<br>
| But, like the stars, they are forever out of reach</p>

| <p>Life is corrupted<br>
| Corruption like cancer<br>
| A slowly encroaching force, flowing freely in the veins of us all<br>
| Leading to hatred and ridicule<br>
| Leading to the outcast of others<br>
| Taking the life and replacing it with a void</p>

| <p>Pain is all<br>
| All is pain<br>
| Never a release<br>
| Never a light or hope<br>
| Only pain</p>

| <p>We all live a lie<br>
| A lie about love and happiness<br>
| The emotions that are felt<br>
| But are never returned<br>
| And leave only pain</p>

| <p>Life is a void<br>
| A deep all encompassing blackness, empty of all emotion<br>
| Pinpricks of hope dot this bleakest of landscapes<br>
| Like stars in a clear night sky<br>
| But, like the stars, they are forever out of reach</p>

Untitled One
^^^^^^^^^^^^

| My life it was so empty<br>
| So devoid of anything real<br>
| The emotions you called forth from me<br>
| From so deep down in my soul<br>
| Were ones I thought I would never feel</p>

| <p>But still I am so lonely<br>
| And depression rules my life<br>
| Because I live in the knowledge<br>
| That what I feel for you, you will never feel with me<br>
| And this brings me nought but strife</p>

| <p>Merely a glance at you<br>
| Will set my soul afire<br>
| But I feel melancholy simultaneously<br>
| For I know we could never realy talk as friends<br>
| And this is my deepest desire</p>

| <p>Why must we be so different<br>
| Why can't you feel the same?<br>
| I wish just for one day<br>
| You could know the exhultation I feel<br>
| Whenever I hear your name</p>

Untitled Two
^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Continual nightmare
| That's my world
| Never does it end

| But this is no dream
| I cannot awake
| My heart will never mend
