August 1999

Tue, 31 Aug 1999
----------------

Bugger. Looks like the low reading was the blip... Oh well, I knew I needed to
lose weight - I now have a reason to start. Is it enough to motivate me to get
up off of my fat arse though? It would be a lot easier if I didn't work so far
from home.  I suppose Monday and Tuesday I could spend an hour down the St
Albans swimming pool. I could start skating to the train again. Two bad things
about that 1) the weather won't hold out much longer 2) I will stink when I get
into work. I will never take up jogging because it bored me silly when I tried
in the past. I suppose I could get one of those electric muscle stimulation
things and use it in the office - that would help my stomach... Swimming isn't
really an option - I am planning more tattoos, and you're not supposed to go
swimming for a couple of weeks afterwards. Bugger. The thought of going to the
gym bores me. Is there any type of exercise that I would enjoy and there aren't
any barriers to me doing it? Not that I know of. It's looking more and more
like I will have to give up drinking for a while to lose weight. Not sure if I
have the willpower to do that :)

   <p align="left">Got mum to give me a lift into town. Saved me a 20 minute walk, but made
   me very early - so here I am again. Didn't sleep very well at all last night. Kept waking
   up for no apparent reason. I have a minor headache. A little hungry too, that will pass.

   <p align="left">Goddamn! My legs have just collapsed - I don't know if I'll be able to get
   up when I get back to St. Albans - or if I'll be able to get up in the morning... I hope I
   don't get cramps tomorrow morning - cramps really bite. Plenty to drink, so I will sleep
   well. Can't write anymore. Rest. Taxi. Bed. I've just noticed that I didn't put any socks
   on before I came out earlier. Bizarre.</p>

   - would be going a different way from here on anyway... That was fun. Eating all sorts of
   crap - pissing against walls - walking for miles while listening to reggae. No - not a
   Friday night down the paradise bar - a Monday afternoon / evening at the Notting Hill
   carnival. Train is even more packed now - people must have walked to Edgware to avoid the
   crush on the train. Didn't work. Have a break, have a kit-kat.</p>

   <p align="left">Fun, fun, fun. A train ride to the carnival. Am meeting the others at
   Charing Cross - a computer crowd again. Hope there's not too much shop talk - I try to
   stay away from computer talk at weekends. Hah, says the guy that spent most of yesterday
   and this morning on Everquest. Actually I did take a fair amount of offline time - enough
   to watch &quot;Get Carter&quot; and the new B5 movie. Not as bad as Matt said it was, but
   certainly not the best B5 thing ever. Time to put that cash cow out to pasture, she's all
   milked out. Hope he doesn't screw up the comic he has just started writing - it had a
   promising first issue. Finished reading the big book of Grimm this morning. Superb.
   Silence - no music anyway - just the sound of the train on the tracks. Pulling into Kings
   Cross now am going to be very early. No matter - I'm sure I can find something to do. Need
   the loo - back in a tick... Relaxed. Doctors again tomorrow - hope the BP is still low.
   What can I do at Charing Cross? Bookshop outside is good for wasting some time. Could get
   another coffee. If the bar is open I could get a beer. I wonder what the bank holiday
   opening hours are...</p>

   Second time in one day actually - the first time was well past midnight. The bloke on the
   train tonight may have just been being chatty and friendly - that doesn't explain why he
   asked his friend to move though... Am I giving off some sort of subconscious signal?</p>

   working for an ISP - you get a choice of platforms for your site. It's a pity Mum's PC
   broke down and she had to hijack the PC I was going to co-locate :( I think I'll sit back
   and read the Big Book of Grimm - comic adaptations of fairy tales from the brothers Grimm
   in all their original gory glory. Back then it was OK to scare your kids - now kid's

   how, it isn't an airport...) to Germany, I ended up getting on the wrong one - somehow I
   was in the rear compartment with someone I knew (I can't remember who, I think it may have
   been Simon from University, but I'm not sure) - the rear compartment was depressurised and
   we kept getting blown about and had to hold onto the seats to stop from getting dragged
   out of the plane.&nbsp; For some reason we stopped at Bedford (again a place with no
   airport). We got out and found that the plane was actually bound for the Seychelles - we
   went to leave the station and bumped into a woman in the foyer who seemed to have all of
   the travel brochures printed that year crammed into her bag.&nbsp; We discussed flight
   plans and the reasoning behind them.</p>

   There is no-one else around, I feel no urge to prove myself. No urges at all. Just peace.
   The stars are out tonight. The street lamps should be turning off soon, the view of the
   stars then should be amazing. Last track on the CD. I will sit here and enjoy the silence
   when it is over. Moonlight glisters through the trees. The church bell has just struck a
   lonesome one. I can't believe that I am sat here barefoot in the middle of the night. It
   is so peaceful, I don't want to leave, but I am tired and it will take about 45 mins to
   walk home. A barefoot walk across the lawn and then home. G'nite.</p>

   purely to get my comics. I may try a few bookshops to see if they have any decent books
   with dragon art. Eyes too big for my stomach. Just bought a half chicken, bought a tin of
   Spam earlier. Haven't eaten either. I found myself singing in the office earlier. Not
   good. I don't think anyone noticed. Waking up beside you by Stabbing Westward. Top tune.
   Job's a good un. Nothing to give - nothing inside. Vacuum. Void. What do I have to offer?
   Mental corruption. There are some good health &amp; safety warnings in Psyber Magick by

   just over a week. Self centred devil spawn - this makes me durable. I love this album
   (Sexless Demons and Scars by Jack off Jill). Going to the carnival Monday - Dan is calling
   me on Sunday - assuming he can get his phone sorted out - otherwise he will be SMSing me.
   Or using a phonebox. Plutocrat. I feel weird having money left at the end of the month.
   It's not really my money - it's credit - but that doesn't really matter. I can still spend
   it if I want to. Super asshole, super nothing. Wash off the scabs dear, or fingernail pick

   read a couple of chapters of Quantum Psychology by Robert Anton Wilson - that book
   seriously fucks with my head. I shouldn't read more than one chapter at a time as I don't
   take it all in. It is my intent to not to use the word 'is' or the verb 'to be' wherever
   an alternative exists. I don't think I can do this without doing a few more of the
   exercises in the book. Annihilation of the self. A worthy goal. The Tao is what remains
   when you subtract the universe from itself. The deconstruction - reconstruction of the
   self is something I have never been very good at. I need to go back to the early exercises
   of the Chaoetica. Focus slips. Fade to grey.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">How pointless was that? I didn't go to get my comics because I wanted to
   go for a drink, and then everyone leaves after I've only had time for one. I almost stayed
   on alone, but I would have just got pissed and depressed by the fact that I was alone.
   Leaving now I am annoyed, but nothing terminal. I wish I was the sort of person that could
   chat to people in bars, but I'm not, which means I can only go for a drink when other
   people are up for it. I am seriously fucking annoyed, but I have no reason to be. I hate
   myself when I am irrational. I hate myself most of the time. I hate everything most of the
   time. I just need to stew in my juices for a while, I will be OK later. Maybe. I am
   seriously tempted by the idea of buying a bottle of vodka and drinking myself into
   unconsciousness. I don't want to tread that path again. There are many things I have done
   in the past which scare me. Temples are throbbing, why am I so angry about a few drinks?
   The first time in a long time the inner demons have been quiet - was looking forward to
   having a few drinks just for fun. I think it's the lack of company that upsets me more
   than the drinks. I like sitting there talking about nothing of consequence - I am really
   disappointed it isn't going to happen. It's amazing how talking to someone and trying to
   maintain a facade of calm politeness calms you down. That and the thought of food.
   Ordering burger king has calmed me.</p>

   Back to being a twat. I wish the display in the train said the same as on the board on the

   I don't care much anymore. I will enjoy what I have and let everything else fall into
   place. I don't know how long this feeling will last - if it is a bad day at work it could
   be over by lunchtime - if not then it could last a few months. This diary may well start
   to peter out - it's main purpose was as an outlet - if I have little to vent then I have
   no reason to fill it in. Mess. The emptiness in my chest is still there, but it doesn't
   bother me. I find myself getting lost in the music. I will give up on this entry and

   better if I had mentioned that I am currently listening to Candyass by Orgy. Or perhaps
   not. &quot;Don't waste your fucking time&quot; - sage advice, but I do not heed it. Nil

   Do I? I don't know. It feels like need - but I have done without thus far, so it is
   probably want. Not as impulsive as most of my wants. I can be patient sometimes - but only
   within certain limits. I. Filthy. Sick. Unpure. Unclean - beware. Train. Tightness. I will
   always be me. A slave to apathy. Tell me what to do - I don't want to think - I am a sheep

   have always liked dizziness - not the after effect of spinning kind though. I always like
   the dizziest characters - Willow, Harpo, Phoebe, La-La, Andy and Lucy in Twin Peaks, Stan
   Laurel - the list continues. I guess I am attracted by insanity. Not sure how that works -
   I thought it was supposed to be opposites that attract. Sky like scales. How should I
   feel? What are those around me feeling? I don't care. Only the interior matters. The rest

   Cross. Time to finish the thought I was in the middle of - I really liked my new ring, but
   everyone else thinks it's crap. Typical. There is a woman further up the carriage that
   looks exactly like the short, overweight, brown haired, glasses wearing member of the

   <p align="left">It is difficult to write about happiness. The story I am writing at the
   moment involves a period of contentment for the primary character. I have just written a
   short piece of this part of the story - it is very difficult to write of things you only
   know from second-hand accounts. I don't know if I will ever finish the story for precisely
   this reason. I have been listening to the same track on repeat for about three quarters of
   an hour now. Time to listen to the rest of the CD. Couples on the train again. How can I
   think happy thoughts when I am so down. I feel a Buffy quote coming on: &quot;Excuse me,
   but could I borrow her?&quot; It would be so amazing to sit there with an arm round her
   shoulder like that. Exchanging her for someone I genuinely cared for would be even better.
   Better than perfection? That would be pretty damn good. Feet distract me again. This time
   it is the bare feet of a total babe - not the brogued feet of a businessman. I need sleep.

   I'll stop the music and watch the sky until the train arrives. Things to do when I get
   back. Start a CD copy going - I've got four to copy - it will be much less boring if I
   leave it to copy unattended. Bloke has just sat next to me - no space to spread out for
   stargazing. Bollocks. This is one of those songs that says the things that I wish I could
   have thought of myself - I wish I didn't like this. This is not the way I picture me.
   Something about this so very wrong. Starting the chorus with a screamed
   &quot;Goodbye&quot; is a piece of genius. Sitting here with my head bent back looking at
   the sky earned me a few funny looks - it is relaxing - I like searching the clouds for

   Inside my shell I wait and bleed. When I cut myself for the first time I did not know it
   was so common - I didn't have a single song that mentioned it - now I have dozens. The
   first song that mentioned it is the one I relate to least - NIN - the downward spiral.
   Trent hurt himself to prove that he could still feel - not my motivation. I have read some
   of the case studies in my mum's psychology books and my reason seems to be pretty common -
   physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain. The frustration flows out of the
   wound with the blood. Another one of those entries that I want to censor. I have got to
   stop thinking about how those reading this will react. It doesn't matter anyway, that
   episode of my life is over - I still find myself thinking about it though - not surprising
   when I have listened to at least three songs that mention it this morning. Coffee splash -
   misses my shirt - not like me. Do I regret? No. The only reason I stopped was the scars.
   Another grey day. Was looking through a training brochure with Claire yesterday - it was a
   winter/spring brochure - I asked whether there is an autumn/winter one out yet - realising
   as soon as I said it that it is only August - summer is not over yet - it just seems like
   it. I don't like summer - autumn is by far my favourite season.</p>

   <p align="left">I looked up the origin of the word &quot;nightmare&quot; this morning - I
   was wrong about the origins of the components being obvious...</p>
   <p align="left">Interestingly, the mare in nightmare has nothing to do with a female
   horse. Instead, it comes from Old English maere 'goblin, incubus.' The word was nigt-mare
   in 1300, and it referred to an evil female spirit afflicting sleepers with a feeling of
   suffocation. By 1350, it was nytmare and in 1440 it was nyghte mare. Mare 'goblin' is a
   cognate with Middle Dutch mare, maer 'incubus,' Old High German mara, Middle High German
   mar, mare (dialectical modern German Mahr 'nightmare'), and Old Icelandic mara 'incubus.'
   Mare comes from the Proto-Germanic word *maron.</p>
   <p align="left">Nightmare was used to describe 'a bad dream caused by an incubus' in the
   16th century, and by 1829 it was used to describe 'a bad dream' in general.</p>

   shaking. I do not want this. I. Writing stops. Staunched flow. Scabbing over. Haemophilic
   thoughts. I have always had a thing about bleeding - when I was very young I would always
   lick any cut I got. I still do to this day. I managed to avoid licking my tattoo. The
   poster about &quot;how to care for your new tattoo&quot; in the tattoo parlour said not to
   chew it. Aimed at people with tattoos in places such as the back of their hands or such
   like - brought about amusing visions of people chewing their arms or legs. Two stops. Time
   for bed. I will try to synchronise again, don't know if it will work. Some bloke has his
   foot up in the air - it keeps appearing in my peripheral vision and distracting me - he's
   getting off here. Radlett. What a fucking stupid name for a town. Then again what names
   aren't? I live in a town named after a saint. With my views about organised religion that
   really bites. Hmmm, all that stuff about homosexuality and then I find myself enjoying
   myself listening to Placebo. Quite a few books I like feature quite explicit homosexuality
   - I have no problem with it as long as there is no chance of it featuring me. If I did
   then there is no way that I would enjoy Anne Rice or Poppy Z. Brite so much. I wish there

   <p align="left">Relaxing. It's been a looong time since I walked across central London at
   night while sober. It loses a lot when you are drunk. During the day the city is too
   crowded - it's like an infestation, some kind of plague. At night that is different -
   there is enough life that you always know you are not alone, but not enough that your
   personal space is constantly violated. A time for contemplation. Got the direction wrong
   and ended up hitting the main road nearer Euston than Kings Cross. Started daydreaming at
   the end. Sentimental slush - bump into someone I know (the who changes several times
   during the walk) going in the same direction - she's cold - I lend her my coat and we walk
   with our arms around each other's shoulders. We arrive at the station, kiss briefly and
   then part. That's as far as it goes. I wish something like that could happen in real life,
   but even if I had met someone I would probably have offered my coat, but the arms around
   the shoulders and kiss would never have happened. Sitting between two touchy-feely couples
   - just what I don't need. The train will be here soon. More couples on the train. Talking
   about inconsequential things. I will listen to music - it's less depressing. Back in my

   problem is that the thought of intimate contact with another bloke makes me feel sick. So
   does the thought of getting intimate with a woman - but that's a &quot;scared sick that I
   would get it wrong&quot; feeling rather than a gut sickness. I'm not that lonely. What
   right do I have to feel so down? I have a job that I enjoy (most of the time), I have
   enough money that I can waste it on toys like CD players and this palmtop... There are a

   exploded. What does anything mean. I feel like a walk tonight. I might get the train all
   the way to Charing Cross and walk to Kings Cross. That should calm me down a bit. Constant
   desperation is wearing me down. Still quarter of an hour until the train - why did I come
   down so early? Why do I ever do anything? Poor impulse control. I envy your demise. No
   stars in the sky tonight. Breeze is cool. Soothing. Was a clumsy twat again today - had a
   carton of drink and it leaked - turning the chest of my shirt a bright shade of pink.

   <p align="left">Watched the Wicker Man this morning - one of my favourite films - I love
   the sort of film where a white Christian policeman with a high moral standard can be the
   bad guy. He's the bad guy from my point of view anyway - a lot of other people would
   probably disagree. I am standing here poised to write and yet can get nothing down.
   Thoughts flicker through my mind - nothing substantial - unsubstantiated judgements on
   those around me - he's an arsehole - she looks gorgeous - why is this cunt sitting so
   close to me, there are plenty of other seats. He's gone now - I wonder if he was
   psychic... Being psychic would be a total nightmare - first impressions are rarely good
   (mine aren't at any rate...) It would be hard walking around knowing that everyone hates
   you and not being able to blame it on paranoia. I often find myself wondering about the
   origin of words - some are fairly obvious, such as breakfast and wardrobe - no back story
   there just a functional definition. Other words not so much - where does nightmare come
   from - it is a composite word with obvious roots, but no obvious meaning - I bet there is
   a pretty cool myth behind that phrase, I could probably find out in about fifteen minutes
   on the Net if I wasn't so apathetic. End of side-track - back to the plot (what little
   there is) Judge in haste, repent at leisure - more of a paraphrase than a quote - seems to
   be a pretty good summation of me. I like to think I don't judge by appearance - but I do,
   I can't help it. I try to keep unsubstantiated stuff relegated to my internal monologue
   and when the conscious mind kicks in I try to give a fair chance - but it doesn't excuse
   the snap judgements. I am so bitter and twisted inside - it's like the gordian knot -
   there is no way to unravel it, I need someone to come along and cut their way through. I
   am dwelling again. I need a hobby - one that involves a face to face interaction with
   others - but I can't think of anything worth doing, something that inspires me to get off
   of my fat arse. Instead I have my solitary hobbies - music, comics, the Internet, tattoos.
   Why do I want to decorate my body in places no-one will ever see? Bugger, didn't do this
   weeks picture for the diary - I knew there was something else I meant to do last night.

   <p align="left">Creative journalism, I seem to be a master of it internally - I see things
   where there is nothing, I probably do the inverse too - but I don't notice that. I wish I
   could be more objective about it. Random thought with a lot of weight behind it: am I
   afraid of women in some way? Probably. If it had been a bloke I was talking to last night
   I probably have kept going until he told me to fuck off (or pretended to go offline and
   added me to his ignore list) but it wasn't and for some reason I felt uncomfortable saying
   exactly the sort of thing I pour out regularly here. Not quite true - there are only a few
   blokes I will open up to. I guess I have just known rejection before and do not want to
   know it again - it just hurts more from a woman because it reinforces my fears about being
   alone forever. Aaah! How I love to rationalise things away with pseudo-psychology early in
   the morning.</p>

   <p align="left">I am a tactile person. I don't like passing by behind glass - I like to be
   down in the dirt - I like to touch and smell the landscape, to taste and hear it -
   reducing it to vision only butchers the experience. I'm going to go out for a long walk
   when I get back - I haven't done that for a while - I'll take shoes with me, unlike the
   times I did the communing with nature thing in Southampton. It was an interesting
   experience - but digging the glass out of my feet afterwards was a real drag. I may end up
   paying a visit to the graveyard at the head end of town - there's nothing quite as
   relaxing as a graveyard at night. I fear me so badly. I think I'll watch the Wicker Man
   when I get back - I love that film - while I don't agree with human sacrifice I get a real
   kick from the pagans triumphing in the end - not falling under the iron boot of
   Christianity (also Edward Woodward is burnt to death at the end - any film where that
   happens has got to be an instant classic). Why do I publish this? I keep finding myself
   wanting to censor where I repeat myself - because other people won't want to hear the same
   thing over and over again. That wasn't the reason for starting this - the idea was to rant
   to the world to get all of the bottled up shit inside out into the open, so it doesn't
   just fester internally. The idea of censoring in order to keep the reader interested is
   antithesis - I certainly don't want to upset the regular reader (I work with most of the
   regulars, so it would be a little silly to alienate myself from them) but I also don't
   particularly want to pander to them. If I don't get the repetition down then it is going
   to fester and only the first mention of any topic will actually be of any use to me. At
   the end of the day I am doing this for selfish reasons.</p>

   <p>Neck still hurts. I am going to my sister's this weekend - there

   got back last night - a little time on the Net sorted that out. ICQ
   rules - a brief exchange of paranoid delusions about people I work
   with soon picked me up again. I don't know if I'll be able to keep
   this up in the car for long before getting travel sick. Chaz explained
   the &quot;waffles&quot; Russell's recipe that he put in the internal
   newsletter - I understand it now, it would be funny if it had been
   attributed to someone that had even the remotest chance of it
   happening to (well, mildly amusing anyway). Obsessing on fantasies
   again. I wish I wasn't so obsessive - I latch onto something and don't
   let go. Too hot to have the window up, and if I leave it down it blows
   my hair into my face. Lots of traffic today on the M25 - could be a
   long trip. Radio on - mildly amusing. Just realised that I haven't
   brought my coat.  Can't buy anything - probably a good thing. I was
   very disappointed with the range of art books in Forbidden Planet
   yesterday - not a single decent coffee table book of dragon pictures -
   a couple of contenders, but either bad art or not enough pictures. How
   am I supposed to get across my vision in the tattoo parlour without
   some example art? I can't draw myself, so have to rely on the talent
   of others. There weren't many examples of non-oriental dragons in the
   tattoo magazines I bought either. A very funny picture of a guy that
   has the two Ronnies tattooed on his back - laugh? I nearly shat. Not
   something I want myself, but if he's happy with it then good luck to
   him. Half an hour to get to Kings Langley. Not good progress. Chaz
   suggested getting the ronnies tattooed on his bollocks - I think
   Rigsby and Miss Jones from Rising damp would suit him better - or
   perhaps Worzel Gummidge and Aunt Sally or Terry and June or Hinge and
   Bracket... lol - waiting in this traffic is driving me insane. More
   insane. It is far too hot. Stopped again. It'll be time to turn around
   and come back by the time we hit the M40. If we ever get that
   far. Police shoot past in the hard shoulder. I like the current
   Madonna track but don't know why. It has none of what I usually like
   in a track. When I like a chart track a fear comes over me. Chilled
   bone-deep. I wish it was a physical chill. I hate the heat. The
   sunlight burns. Almost up to the maximum size for an entry - start a

   idea to go out drinking tonight - will just get hammered and
   abusive. That probably won't stop me though.  Need to relax. I'm gonna
   try some meditative techniques - bbl. That's better - it's amazing how
   a few minutes of internal silence can calm you down. I'm going down
   onto the underground now, so the calm probably won't last long. I'll

   wouldn't have to put up with the constant clutching at straws that I
   find myself doing after the most mundane issues. That probably doesn't

   for many things. I am in real danger of falling asleep. Can't think -
   here's the train. Quiet going this direction - usually that would be a
   good thing, but this morning I could do with some bustle. No music
   today - I don't feel the need - first time in ages I've done that. So
   tired that the seats on the train seem comfortable. I probably won't
   go straight to bed when I get back - I should do - I only have time
   for about 6 hours sleep before I will need to get up again. Why do I

   uplifting. Today it tugs my heart in both directions. I like to see
   beautiful people frown - it's strangely satisfying to know that they
   have troubles too. I don't like thinking that - I don't want the pain
   of others to give me pleasure. I am very conscious of looking at
   people. I am not very good at eye contact - whenever I catch someone's
   eye I look away because I find it impossible to imagine that they
   would want me looking at them - so I look away to spare them. It's the
   beginning of a very long work day. Got up too early this morning - a
   complex task ahead of me in the early hours - I need to be fresh, but
   that isn't likely. Need to make sure I make myself a foolproof plan -
   if such a beast exists. I wonder how long it will take for Andy's copy
   of EverQuest to arrive. He is using my account until his copy arrives
   - we had our first clash today - Andy was playing when I connected and

   <p>Had a few drinks. I had an ICQ conversation earlier which I have
   decided will be the basis of my first pre-meditated entry
   here. Tequila is kicking in. Dan &amp; Dave decided to get mohicans
   for charity - I wonder if that idea will stand the cold light of
   day. OK, time for my bizarre conspiracy theory (not entirely my
   idea...) Computers (windows PCs especially) are predators - they hunt
   the unwary and unprepared. Ever wondered why your PC crashed at
   *exactly* the wrong time? It's because they feed on frustration, anger
   and despair. The science is that they only need electricity to run,
   but in reality this is like living on bread and water. They crave
   negative emotion, and if none is forthcoming they will find a way to
   generate it. This also explains why so many geeks are good with
   computers - the ambient emotional turmoil is plenty for the computer -
   it doesn't need to crash to generate more. My computer has more than
   enough to sustain it from my diary entries, and has no need to
   crash. This enables me to work uninterrupted by crashes and get a lot
   more done - ultimately resulting in much more comfort while working
   with computers. Surreal transaction between a guy in a suit and a
   bunch of trendies - I'm glad I can't hear it, it is a lot more mundane
   than it looks. He is clutching on his coke bottle like his life
   depends on it. I probably look the same with my bag of crisps. Who am
   I. I think I have lost the plot of my earlier rampant paranoia. The
   only serious problem I had with this theory is that I cannot believe
   that either Microsoft or Intel actually have the ability to put any
   intelligence into their software or hardware - but as I had pointed
   out to me - predatory cunning does not necessarily indicate high
   intelligence. As if I needed any help in being paranoid... There are
   people out there who believe this sort of crap too - people less alone
   than me. I wish I truly believed something - I could share that belief
   with someone. As a sceptic I have nothing for myself, let alone
   something to share... I want to fade to grey. There is a statistical
   chance that the sun will go nova tomorrow. If the many worlds theory
   of quantum mechanics all possibilities exist in perpendicular
   universes. This means that somewhere this will all be over tomorrow.
   Somewhere it was all over today. Joy. Rapture. Please. Pleas. Still
   far to go. I will get there eventually. Can I live in denial? Build a
   little fantasy world where I can be happy and retreat into it. I don't
   think I have a good enough imagination to think of such a place.</p>

   <p>Has all trace of the positivity I gained recently disappeared? No,
   it is still there. I don't know if I like it - I dream impossible
   dreams, but nothing actually improves. There is more chance for
   disappointment - if you hope for the worst then you will never be
   disappointed. I am at heart positive - I will never give up on life,
   but I don't like the frustration it brings. I close my eyes and wish
   for all the bad to go away - but I know that will never happen. I hate
   the unknown. The impenetrable curtain that divides the present from
   the future - so much more frustrating than the funhouse mirror that
   divides present and past - this image is warped, but at least it is
   there. I sometimes enjoy the anticipation of what is around the
   corner, but not on a large scale. I am become a self fulfilling
   prophecy. I used to imagine that things would sort themselves out in
   time - I am not so sure now - I have seen the years slip by with
   nothing new but the surroundings - the room has been repapered, but
   the furnishings are still the same - just me standing shivering on the
   rug in the centre. I used to joke with a friend at school that I would
   have had a girlfriend by the age of twenty - he found my placing the
   event that far in the future amusing - I am now twice as far into the
   future and it has still not happened and I don't know why. Plenty of
   quiet people are not alone, plenty of ugly people are not alone,
   plenty of fat people are not alone, plenty of fucked up people are not
   alone. Plenty of quiet, ugly, fat, fucked up people are not alone. I
   am. What is wrong with me? Is it just because I am so tied up in my
   own self doubt that I don't see the opportunity? Or is it that the
   opportunity is never there to begin with? I guess I just need to wait
   until my fear of loneliness exceeds my fear of rejection - if that
   ever happens - my inhibitions should crumble at that point. How many
   more years? One? Two?  Eighty? I wish I knew what I need to change - I
   could then decide if I am willing to change it. A quick note to Dan -

   with enough time to run for it - but I couldn't be bothered. Thoughts
   centred on fantasy that could become reality if it wasn't for my lack
   of confidence. I hate the games we play. I admire honesty and expect
   it from others - I can never quite bring myself to practice what I
   preach - I will always answer honestly if asked a direct question, but
   I am only able to follow - never to start things off. What if there
   was someone right for me, who was like me in this respect - my fear of

   smoking in this film. They swim - the mark of satan is upon them. Wow
   - old man Steptoe as a horse seller. Children roast potatoes in the
   ashes of witches. How could anyone ever believe such atrocities could
   be committed for the greater good? Such has always been the way of
   organised religion - the inquisition, the crusades, witch hunts
   (numerous examples) - I have read the Malleus Maleficarum, the
   inquisitor's handbook on the powers and practices of witches. Written
   by a mysoginistic monk in the fifteenth century, it is the cause of
   the death of thousands of innocents. I have no problem with people
   having beliefs, but see no good in the organised religions and the way
   they force their beliefs on others. I should have picked a different

   a surprised &quot;that's actually quite nice&quot; to a couple of
   &quot;very cool&quot;s, even one &quot;I love it&quot; - I didn't do
   it for the opinion of other people, but it is a nice bonus. The city
   is a symphony in grey (probably misquoted - sorry). Very true - I'm

   can't remember being this way at First year camp at secondary school -
   I was definitely brooding at second year camp though - that's eleven
   to twelve years of habit to break - not easy - I could use some help,
   but that isn't likely until after it is done. Catch 22 - good film, I
   never read the book. So many books, so little time. Not hungry enough
   to finish my sandwich. I must have something wrong with me. So
   tired. Can hardly think. Will eat the other beef strip I bought and
   then give up on the food. I find these strips of uncured leather to be
   strangely appetising - another reason to fear me :) A starless sky
   over featureless ground. Sodium glow lights the way for iron
   horse. The road is empty and so am I. The ground is damp, but the rain
   is long gone. Take the night and wrap it around me. Eyes ache from
   constant phosphorescence - I need to get out more. Pale skin, never
   revealed. Empty carpark - one stop to go. Taxi? No, I shall walk. More

   <p>How much do the opinions of others matter? Today is the day I get
   the opinions of others about my newly revealed interest in body art. I
   haven't told mum about it - she won't mind the tattoo, but she's
   likely to ask questions about the scars next to it. I don't really
   want to receive counselling from my mother about a phase that I have
   already passed through. This train is shaking lots - it's difficult to
   make a diary entry when your hand is shaking. Coffee is very hot,
   almost burning my hand through the cup. I fell over on the way to the
   station - trod on a stone on a hill and it moved - my leg flew out
   from under me an I fell on my arse like a total prat. The grazes on my
   hand itch far more than the picture on my arm, even at it's worst. As
   any regular readers (there are some - to my great surprise) may have
   noticed the feelgood factor of getting a tattoo and not regretting it
   afterwards has taken my mind off waiting for emails. No sign of the
   mail I'm waiting for - but I can live with it. The fear of regretting
   it was the main thing that stopped me getting a tattoo before. After
   four or five years of seriously considering it I knew I wanted one,
   now I have got one and really like it - there is no fear now - others
   will be following soon. My major custom job - a bloody great dragon on
   my back - will probably have to wait until November until it is
   started. If I go on holiday in October it may have to wait until the
   new year so that I will have enough holiday to get it done - I reckon
   it will be at least five days off to get it done - I'm assuming they
   won't want to work on a single customer for a full day - if they don't
   then it could probably be done in two, I think I'd want to take a
   break though - eight hours in the chair with short coffee breaks would
   be very boring I wouldn't be able to watch him work either. If I don't
   go on holiday in October then I'll be able to start earlier, and will
   have plenty of holiday to spare. I need to have a look into how much
   holiday I have today - I could possibly have fourteen or fifteen days
   left - if I have then I don't have any problems. Today is the first
   time in a long time that I have worn a t-shirt to work - probably the
   first time since I stopped working weekends. I don't really feel right
   - some people wear t-shirts all the time - but I feel almost too
   relaxed. It had to be done though - it will be a lot less disruptive
   to my day to roll my sleeve up when someone asks to see the tattoo
   than to take my shirt off. All I feel is hollow and bruised. I've not
   really noticed how relevant to me the lyrics of this song are. All
   alone, except for my rage. Nothing to give - nothing inside. This is a
   superb concept album - the descent of a man into depression and
   suicide after being left by his girlfriend. I scratch and tear - until
   it bleeds - I do not want - I only need. This could be me in a couple
   of years - I may never get to the girlfriend stage so don't have to
   worry too much... God I'm a miserable git. The sun is reflecting from
   the windows of Guy's hospital right into my face - I think I'll
   move. Very cool wispy clouds overhead. Looks pretty grey in the
   direction I'm going. I must be in a good mood today - I'm actually
   enjoying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling the sun on the back of my neck. By
   you. Bayou. I wonder if Louise has had a chance to read those Poppy
   Z. Brite books yet. I haven't been reading much over the last couple
   of weeks, but the thought of re-reading Lost Souls or Drawing Blood is
   quite appealing. I just remembered that if I don't go to Texas in
   October then I'll be going to New York...  Maybe I still won't have
   extra holiday allowance left...</p>

   clear.&nbsp; I will be able to sleep without having to do any work -
   that is something at least.&nbsp; God, I am such a lazy bastard.&nbsp;
   I knocked the stack of videos off of my speaker - Videodrome fell
   behind the chest of drawers and I had to lean round the back without
   putting any pressure on it - if I leant on it it would probably fall
   on top of me.&nbsp; Quick ICQ conversation with Andy - had what sounds
   like a very nasty virus on Saturday - I hope I didn't get it while out
   drinking with him on Friday...&nbsp; Have to pause here - one of my
   favourite songs of all time...</p>
   
   <p>Tattoo feels warm - I think I can actually feel the healing.&nbsp;
   Some small scabs have formed on the darkest parts - doesn't look as
   bad as I thought it would - you have to look pretty close to see them,
   not obscuring any detail in the tattoo...&nbsp; Just looked to my left

   <p>Diane - some things we cannot find anywhere, but we dream they can
   be found in other people. The woods are wondrous here - but
   strange. Nadine's return to childhood is the product of a twisted
   mind. This whole program is an act of twisted genius. Andy Brennan is
   a whole damn town. Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.  Are
   you looking for secrets? The dull rumble of the waterfall soothes. I
   wish I was there.  The moment between Pete and Tajimura is purely
   there for repeat watching - not many people would remember on a single
   watching. He is Bob - eager for fun - he wears a smile - everybody
   run. Another Lynch episode - this should be fun. Why are all the navy
   people bouncing balls? I am a lonely soul. He's alive. New
   shoes. Everybody's hurt inside. The sax player goes briefly
   insane. The giant returns. It is happening again. Poor Madeline.  Poor
   Leland. In another time, another place he could have been a seer - a
   shaman priest.  In our world he is a shoe salesman down among the
   shadows. The conversation between Harry and Pete about Josie reminded
   me of a moment from Lost Highway - this episode isn't directed by
   David Lynch, the direction is a very good match. Not a star in the
   sky. The last few steps are always the most difficult. They got the
   wrong man - they've found another body. Time for a food
   break. Albert's back. Another repeat watching nugget - white fox. You
   are on the path, you don't need to know where it leads, just
   follow. Andy Brennan is Stan Laurel. I'll catch you with my death bag
   - you my think I've gone insane - but I promise I will kill again. The
   Twin Peaks athon is going to have to go on hold - I've got to install
   Mum's PC. I hate installing Windows.</p>

   <p>The Twin Peaks athon died a death last night. Thirteen and a half hours
   left. Can still make it within the weekend, but I will no longer achieve

   <div class="story">
   <span class="title">16:46 - Damn good Coffee</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>Diane - meanderings on the Twin Peaks athon. Audrey is insane in
   the first couple of episodes - I hadn't noticed before. The world is a
   dark and dangerous place. With coffee and donuts all will be
   well. Don't forget the pie. Bob will catch you with his death bag.
   She's full of secrets and sometimes her arms bend back. The man from
   another place dances on. Diane - the funeral was a joke. With the
   fight and Leland Palmer falling on the coffin not to mention Albert
   nearly holding up the start. This must be where pies go when they
   die. Sheriff Truman can balance books at a glance. Three hours in and
   I have taken a short break to trim my moustache and beard - look a
   little less wild now (also gives the benefit of not getting in my
   mouth when I eat. Laura speaks to the recorder like I speak to my
   Palm. They shot Waldo. Hurting me. Bite the bullet baby. See you on
   the other side. You made me do it. Trout heading upstream. Au revoir
   Jaques. Didn't notice the bizarre hunchback tailor in one eyed
   jack's. That was a damn fine episode - more twists than a twisty turny
   thing. They need a double length episode next just to straighten
   things up...  Aaah! A pint mug of steaming black joe - just what the
   doctor ordered. The giant comes. I believe that the giant is the dream
   soul of the old room service guy. The owls are not what they seem. Cat
   faced goddess. Everybody wins. It's not so bad as long as you can keep
   the fear from your mind. I would very much like to make love to a
   beautiful woman that I had genuine affection for. My sister has had
   another fight with Paul - we may be gaining a lodger for a
   while. Mares eat oats and does eat oat and little lambs eat ivy - a
   kid'll eat ivy too, wouldn't you? Another visit from Bob. Norma is one
   of those Lynchian characters that is bizarre due to being too
   normal. The hospital food subplot is is a stroke of genius. Albert
   laughing about Nadine is hilarious too. Lots of pie in this episode -
   must have been at least a half dozen flavours mentioned so far. Why do
   the sisters of a major character such as Donna not appear for so long?
   Get happy! Better to listen than talk. Diane - nearly a third of the
   way through now. I have just taken a break to clean my tattoo and
   apply a new coating of skin cream. No sign of any scab forming - just
   a soreness to indicate the healing process. I should probably get some
   sleep to help things along - but at the moment I am quite happy in my
   Twin Peaks athon. I may decide to end it at the end of the Laura
   Palmer case - or I may go on as far as Jean Renault or even as far as
   the black lodge. The grandson magician is a very cool character. Which
   one do we burn. Where does Jerry get all of his cool food? The smoked
   cheese pig is so cool that it hurts. The log lady. I am only going to
   last until the end of the Laura Palmer case. That is another six or
   seven episodes if I recall correctly - about half way. I am very, very
   tired. The first visit to the orchid house. Another of Laura's
   secrets. Meals on wheels.  Are Maddy's visions of Bob indicative of
   abuse by her Uncle? Albert's path is a strange and difficult one. Dick
   Tremayne is an absolute arse. He used to flick matches at me.  That's
   our man. I have just realised who James reminds me of - Ed from
   Northern Exposure.  Without chemicals he points. Mike is
   released. Candy's dandy.</p>

   <p>That wasn't bad at all. I have heard conflicting reports about how
   painful tattoos are - I now know that I can breeze through it. I'm
   gonna book a day off in early September so I can go back for a
   band. There was a really nice one with a wolf's head in the middle
   that I was looking at while I was in the chair - similar to the other
   one I was after except for the head. I'm glad I went for the one I
   chose - it looked pretty good on the page, but the guy doing it (Nutz)
   decided it needed some shading and improvised. It turned out a lot
   better. He thought so too - and took a photo for their gallery. It's a
   pity that it won't look as good on Monday, the first chance I'll get
   to show it off. It'll take about a month for it took look it's best -
   the shading is a bit sharp at the moment and needs time to soften out
   a bit. I'll dig out my web cam and take a picture after I have taken
   the dressing off.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>A good night. A few drinks and a good talk with a friend. I am not
   drunk - yet am happy to be on my way home. A few weeks ago that would
   not be the case. I made my long-term webstats a bit more readable
   earlier - I'm not sure how I managed to fit it in with the other stuff
   I did - I noticed that just before her last email Erin looked around
   my site again - she had looked at this page before she wrote that I
   was a wonderful person and just needed to be more positive. Wow. I
   signed up for an email-SMS gateway - I have not received any messages
   yet though :( The intro messages didn't appear until an hour and a
   half after I registered though.</p>
   
   <p>Buzzing thoughts<br>
   Fuzzy feeling<br>
   I can handle things<br>
   It is all right<br>
   Keep telling myself<br>
   Maybe it will prove true.</p>
   
   <p>Trying to think positive<br>
   Negativity creeps in<br>
   I try to resist<br>
   But habit prevails again.</p>
   
   <p>I really fear. I am. What. Hum. Lonely bleed. Disease to
   feed. Tongue needle vein.  Demise. Despise. Hate. Hurt. External scars
   fade - internally they fester.</p>
   
   <p>I am trying to be positive - why is it so hard? Why do I not like
   me? I am forcing myself to believe things I would never normally
   believe - am I being positive or just setting myself up for a fall? I
   am not cHeWtOy - I cannot talk like I write an email, web or
   ICQ. There is no time to edit - you need to be spontaneous - I don't
   have the bottle to be spontaneous. It takes me forever to pluck up the
   courage to say anything non-work related when talking to a girl. I am
   an arse. West Hampstead. Everyone leaves. There is no eternity but the
   eternity of pain. I will always hurt. If I must be lonely I think I'd
   rather be alone. Lost souls. Which way now. I am going to re-read the
   entire conversation.
   </p>
   
   <p>Why?</p>
   
   <p>I don't know what I want , but I know I want it now. Why are you
   haunting me?.I hate being me. I wish I could be someone else for a
   change. Put my life on hold until I pluck up the guts to come
   back. Torn. The past couple of weeks have brought me back from the
   brink - thank you. I may not be happy with my life - but at least I am
   now content to be me. I only think about myself. I want to think about
   you. I want something real - I only have my fantasies. The fantasies
   of a sad bastard with no creativity or innovation. I hate.</p>

   <p>I seem to be managing to pick all the good ones first - Congo Bill
   - I thought it was going to be some story about a giant monkey -
   should have known to expect more from a Vertigo mini-series. Black
   ops, unexplained murder &amp; mutilation in the jungle investigated by
   US intelligence operatives. Harsh. Cool. No cinnamon syrup left - a
   black coffee replaces my usual latte. Damn good coffee! And hot! I
   think I'm about due for another Twin Peaks marathon. I wonder if I
   could watch the whole lot in one go. Large pot of coffee to accompany
   me - from memory there is about fifteen hours of it. If I was to start
   Saturday afternoon then I should finish early Sunday morning. The
   ending would be pretty damn cool after sleep deprivation - it's enough
   of a headfuck when you're awake!  Sounds like something to keep me
   occupied tomorrow. Cool. You're the truth that I've been seeking -
   'cause my whole life I've been lying. Only you can make me whole -
   just one touch - you complete me. I love this CD - I keep seeing it
   advertised as &quot;the new Stabbing Westward album&quot; - it's not
   new - it's a reissue! It was new about six months ago! Train time
   again. I am not your saviour - I am just as fucked as you. She said
   she didn't want saving in her very first message. Lost soul. No

   <span class="body">
   <p>Bizarre film last night - it was a bloody good vampire B-movie with
   interesting cinematography and a weird moody soundtrack, but right at
   the end they went a bit too OTT - the surreal lesbian sado-masochism
   scene was totally unnecessary - it's good to finish a film on a
   surreal note though... The cHeWtOy review for Curse of the Vampire
   (can't remember the Spanish name Llamada des Vampiros or Lambada de la
   Vampiros or somesuch) is a thumbs up if you love cheesy b-movies. I
   think that bracketed subthought was a bit too long. I have spent far
   too long saying nothing in particular about a certain email. I am
   going to try not to mention it again until it arrives. Friday 13th - a
   date that bodes.  The Machine Head cover of Message in a Bottle is
   pretty good - not experimental enough to be a truly great cover
   though. The new Hellboy story is off to a good start - not too sure
   about the demon in the box knowing Hellboy's secret name - he
   overheard them talking about it in Hell? Why the Hell (whoops,
   unintentional - honest) would demons share things like that? Even
   assuming a demon found Hellboy's secret name - Hellboy has a pretty
   important role in the coming apocalypse, his secret name would be a
   thing of great power - a demon is hardly likely to share that power
   with all and sundry. Maybe I just don't understand Mike Mignola's
   vision of Hell. Backup story was inked by Ryan Sook - I thought he was
   just a random Mignola clone - but if he is appearing in Hellboy then
   he must be an authorised clone. Time to see if I have any more really
   cool comics in this months batch...</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>Top Ten really is very good - kinda like hill street blues with
   super powers... The primary protagonist - Toy Box - is a very cool
   character - both figuratively and literally. A female Jack Knight with
   a badge. An interesting comparison - the more I look at it the deeper
   it runs - an inventor father, following in fathers footsteps, retro
   technology, laid back and deceptively capable. The city is the real
   heart of the story.  Two fifteen CDT. Ack. Churn. Bwahahahaha!!! Now I
   have to decide what to watch - I will lose myself in a film while
   leaving my PC connected and relying on new mail notification to bring
   me back. I think I'll start with a couple of Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts
   and then move on to something darker as the night deepens.</p>

   Austin Powers. Still can't find Dracula with Bela Lugosi though - only
   the Christopher Lee version (and the terrible Gary Oldman/Keanu Reeves

   open - he must be hot too. Time passed without leaving an
   impression. I have no recollection of the last couple of minutes -
   blank slate. Blank stare. I have thought too much today. My brain just
   wants to shut down.  Writing on auto-pilot. Crackle. Head pains -
   sharp tonight - not a dull ache. I am tired.  I will be waiting up
   until I get the email - or until midnight. I have lot's of work to do
   tomorrow. With the tiredness I now feel I need more than 6 hours. Any
   later than midnight and I won't be worth anything tomorrow - any
   earlier than midnight and I won't be able to sleep. Still scared - but
   no longer shivering (outside) my stomach is churning - now I have
   eaten I can feel the butterflies again. I need another look at the
   last email. Be more positive. Stomach still churning - but in an
   uplifting way. Wow. Time for Down in it by NIN - apt at the moment. I
   used to be so big and strong - I used to know my right from wrong - I
   used to never be afraid - I used to be somebody - I used to have
   something inside - Now just this hole that's open wide - I used to

   pops her clogs. Darting around all over the place. A nice soothing
   rain - not too hard, not too cold. Today I love life. Bizarre. Train
   pulls away - mine is next. I've got to concentrate on advanced
   features of project management software this morning. Train. How much
   will I take in? More than I expect - I always do. I am at one with the
   machine. Sometimes I wish everything in life was based on logical
   rules - I would actually be able to contribute socially without
   feeling awkward - without the lows the highs would be hollow though -
   not the dizzying spirals that they are now. I am dizzy now - I want

   on this thing. I only want to read one email. My Buffy comics are in
   my bag this evening - I may be able to calm my mind enough to read
   some of them. As it is I will probably just add them to my unsorted
   pile. A waste - there are probably those that would make good use of
   them. Never mind. Mark seemed to find the train journey we shared to
   be pretty bizarre - I will add an entry here anyway. While we were on
   the platform a woman asked us if we had any free change - I didn't, so
   said no. If I had had some I would still say no. She asked if we were
   homeless - when I said no she said &quot;you are now&quot;. The home
   guard officer on the train shielded us with his wings of steel. In
   time Batfink will be replaced - it's hard luck. I am supposed to be
   able to think about this, but currently I cannot. I just want to go to
   sleep. I don't know what to do. Mister will you please help my pony -
   I think it's his lung. An hour to go. Bugger. I am not sober and I am

   Unexpected training has saved me from low productivity. It's six o two.
   She has probably written by now. I hate the uncertainty. I wonder how long
   it will take me to pluck up the courage to read my email when I get back.
   I watched the eclipse today. Pretty funky - nothing special compared to the
   email I am hoping for though. I am going to read her last email a couple of
   times (yes, I am sad enough to have it printed out and placed in my
   wallet)... I really, really hurt. I love it. I still can't believe
   that email was written about me. Maybe she has her address book
   confused. I am feeling very good - a sure sign of getting shot down in
   flames. I hurt, I am scared. This is not changing. Scares. Scars. I
   don't know if she knows that my scars are more than metaphor. I have
   told her about this site - but have not informed her about any
   updates. I have not seen any sign of her in the stats. When she says
   that my sight is great she may just be blaming it on the depressing
   poetry and the freak page now. Will she notice the other stuff and be
   scared off? I hate. I hurt. I scar. I heal. I feel. Wow. Let me feel

   so long shot down in flames. Why have I not woken up? Waiting for the
   punchline. Visions of a fat bloke in big brown underpants in a trailer
   park - is she real or some sad guy's pretence? A guy as sad as me. If
   she is real then has everything been because she thought I sounded sad
   and needed cheering up before I topped myself? Has my ranting been an
   imposition on her? Is my asking to meet her face to face going to
   scare her? As much as it scares me? All inside is questions - it's 2am
   CDT, no answers expected for hours... I can't breathe properly - am I
   clutching at straws? People get off, others get on. Does anyone else
   feel this torn? I wonder if this is how normality feels. Stop the
   world, I wanna get off. A rollercoaster ride too far. A brief
   interlude - thinking of what to ask in the interview I am conducting
   Friday. Glad I didn't put last night's question off until tomorrow -
   expecting an answer on Friday 13th would be very not good. I have
   always been a logical person - how did my superstition and love of the
   occult come about? Too many late night horror movies as a
   kid. Couldn't find Dracula with Bela Lugosi last time I looked for the
   video - I'll try HMV &amp; Virgin tomorrow if I remember. Comics
   tomorrow - not a big week, but some cool stuff. Top Ten issue 2. Hope
   it lives up to the promise of the first one. Alan Moore is doing so
   much at the moment - and so well too. I thought that with that many
   comics every month they would seem diluted - but each one is two dozen
   pages of sheer brilliance. Calming down now - trains of thought back
   on a straight track. Almost ready for work. I need another coffee
   first though. Wow. She told me I should be more positive - I am trying
   (very trying) - but it is so difficult when people ignore what you are
   saying. I told the woman twice that I wanted black coffee - I get to
   the train and find she has given me white. If I had had my mind on the
   job at hand I would have noticed when I was still in the shop - there
   is no time now, my train is here. I'll drink it anyway, but that's not
   the point. I'll try to enjoy it - after all this is the new shiny
   happy me, overflowing with confidence... lol, maybe I should take it

   say thanks in person. I like having her as a penpal - at the back of
   my mind there is a little voice saying that if we meet then maybe
   things could go further - that's too scary too even think about. The
   little voice has never yet been right in a situation like this
   though. This is the only time in my life that I have been more afraid
   of the word yes than of no. I just can't believe the way I am feeling
   about someone when I have no idea what she looks like. For all I care
   she could be the bearded lady in the local freak show. She is a really
   caring person and has been so patient in listening to my rants. I am
   very very scared about what happens next. I think I have just written
   everything I didn't want to write yesterday morning... not as bad as
   all that after all...</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>Damn, ran out of space for the last entry. I think I was pretty
   much finished anyway though. I make everything into a crisis. In
   actuality I have only ever asked about 3 girls out in my entire life -
   most of the rejection I have experienced has been from things like
   when I was constantly asked out because of dares at school. Rejection
   recently has been due to me being drunk and offensive at the time. How
   could I ever feel confident in a relationship knowing how much I lie
   to myself? &quot;I lie to myself, but I won't lie to you -
   honest.&quot; I wish I had a bigger capacity for deception, but I just
   can't do it.  I have a logical mind and logic says that you can't
   expect to get a correct answer from incorrect data.</p>

   <span class="title">21:39 - Fuck it all</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>A parting. Sad. My emotions are held too deep for me to feel
   anything strongly. I would very much like to be an openly emotional
   person - but I have spent so much time holding things in - afraid
   someone will laugh at something I hold dear. I don't know where I'm
   going with this - my head hurts and I can't concentrate. I will lose
   contact through apathy. It has happened before and will happen
   again. Thirteen minute delay - the hoard of city salespeople are
   annoyed. They obviously don't use this line much. I am tired. I can't
   remember what I have written. Announcements hurt my tender head. Whirr
   of passing train. I really want to be home. I just want to collapse
   into my bed and sleep forever - back onto early shift tomorrow - will
   probably get to sleep for about six hours. They are making
   announcements almost constantly - the sales types are smoking like
   chimneys, comparing sales figures and making very lame
   jokes. Apparently the guy next to me doesn't like dogs - I do. I need
   music - but don't want to wear the headphones in case they crack my
   skull.  I wonder what these guys sell... It's probably something lame
   like double glazing. What does it matter? I guess thinking about them
   stops my introverted monologue from getting too depressing - doesn't
   stop it from getting boring though... Well the idea was to write
   whatever I am thinking. Does this mornings reticence break the spirit
   of this journal? If I have found one thing I am not willing to write
   then I am bound to be able to find something else. A very depressing
   music selection - Icon by Paradise Lost. Depressing both because of
   the music itself and the memories... Time spent alone at university -
   going for days at a time without speaking to anyone. A dark time. Were
   there ever any light times?  Memories of primary school are mainly
   good, but the darkness was apparent even then.  Reduced to tears in
   the first few days by a teacher who thought I was stupid because I had
   messy handwriting. This is all becoming about boring episodes from my
   past. What of today?  Is my life really that boring that there is
   nothing to write about? What happened today?  Got in at midday for a
   meeting - I was due in at one - the meeting didn't happen until one
   anyway. In meetings constantly until about six thirty. Caught up with
   my emails (or attempted to anyway) managed to tidy up and add some
   error checking to my scripts needed for my current project. By nine my
   head was throbbing, so I left a little early and stood on the station
   platform for a while hoping that the cool air would help. It
   didn't. Had a conversation that I couldn't concentrate on in the
   train. To be honest I didn't want to concentrate on it - the day was
   over, and I was keen to let it die. Now we are up to where I started
   this entry. Hardly a stunningly productive day. I don't seem to have
   had many of those in the past couple of weeks. I like my job, but it
   becomes harder and harder to say why. Meetings are eating more and
   more of my time. An uphill downward spiral. I like who I am, but
   sometimes wish I was someone else, someone who isn't lonely. I have
   said that I hate myself before - that isn't quite true. I just hate
   being me. I hate my apathy - I can accept on an intellectual level
   that I need to get up and do something, but I can't actually get up
   off of my arse.</p>

   <p>The air conditioning in my office is broken. The heat and
   concentration have conspired together to bring about a headache that
   is about to split my skull wide open. Ouch. Have nearly cracked the
   project that was due last Friday, but keep coming across new problems.
   Am I losing it? Venting to the world on this page has helped me to
   unwind a knot of tension that has been building for years - was that
   tension what gives me my edge? My memory is terrible recently - it has
   always been bad (for non-technical matters anyway...)  - but
   recently... I hope I don't start losing the technical stuff too - it's
   bad enough not being able to cope with (or find) a social life, if I
   can't do my job I may as well top myself now. Company - more

   <span class="body">
   <p>Coffee, my dark goddess. Pleasure &amp; pain in one hot bitter
   package. Caffeine rush.  Lovely. A light drizzle falls - blanketing
   the earth with a cool, comforting moistness. I have always liked water
   - the beach, a river/stream/canal, swimming pool, puddle, falling from
   the sky or just the trickle of a forgotten tap. I would love to go on
   a canal boat holiday like the one's we had while in the ATC - a superb
   lads holiday - take it in turn to steer the boat and operate the locks
   during the day - moor next to a pub and get absolutely legless every
   night. I was only 14/15 last time - under adult supervision - the
   supervisor's homebrew was what got me drunk most nights :) The
   nostalgia attached to those holidays is probably due to the fact that
   they both had a moment when I actually thought that someone fancied
   me. Wrong on both counts - the first time I was a little tipsy after a
   lager top (hey, I was only 14 - cut me a little slack) One of the
   girls asked me to walk her back to the girl's boat - I walked her back
   - had no idea what to say so I said nothing - we got back to the boat
   - said goodnight and then I went back to my boat - and spent several
   hours brooding over what I could have said. I knew her for another two
   years and she never again showed any interest in me, so I think she
   just didn't want to make the dark walk back to the boat on her
   own. The second boat trip we met a friend at a train station in the
   arse end of nowhere. There was a group of local girls our age hanging
   around the station. Everyone except me managed to pull. Later, when I
   was sitting on the front of the boat brooding to depressing 80s music
   (much like how I spend a lot of my time these days) my friends decided
   to tell me that a girl that I thought absolutely hated me actually
   fancied me. To this day I don't know if they were telling the truth or
   just trying to cheer me up. I can't believe I still think about that -
   it's nearly ten years ago! Let go you depressing git!</p>
   
   <p>Luggage rack reflected in the screen. No luggage on it. There never
   is. Lots of internal turmoil at the moment - how much do I read into
   the comment &quot;I am so glad I met you&quot; I have always known
   that I cannot take a hint - it sounds like a perfectly innocent
   statement - and yet I am considering taking a holiday because of
   it. Am I clutching at straws because I am so lonely, or is she really
   interested? This is the first time I have found it hard to write as
   I'm thinking - I want to write, but I physically cannot continue, it's
   too personal and I know people are reading this. I'm going to stop
   now. Sorry.</p>

   <span class="title">09:43 - Dreaming of you</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>A couple of dream diary entries today:</p>
   
   <p>Went to see some sort of open air concert in Abbots Langley park
   with a load of people I went to secondary school with - I think the
   concert was trance and ambient stuff. &nbsp; I asked some people from
   work if they wanted to come, but they were busy watching the
   news.&nbsp; There were packs of young children roaming the park,
   preying on the weak.  &nbsp; We entered the park as a group and they
   backed away from our superior numbers.  &nbsp; There was a
   groundskeeper standing next to his lawnmower hitting himself
   repeatedly in the crotch with the handles of a pair of garden
   shears.</p>
   
   <p>I am riding in a car with someone around a city - sometimes it
   looks like Watford, but most of the time I don't recognise it.&nbsp;
   The driver is speeding, we go past some police cars, and they give
   chase.&nbsp; The driver tries to outrun them.&nbsp; We get out of the
   line of sight of the police and pull into a side road - we get out,
   run through a crowded marketplace, and hide behind a wall.&nbsp; I
   hear a voice telling me to get away from the wall.&nbsp; I am slow to
   react.&nbsp; When I move away the voice says &quot;Too slow, you've
   been made&quot;.&nbsp; A trapdoor opens and we both feel compelled to
   jump down it.&nbsp; I wake up later in a large arena - I have had
   cybernetic wings grafted onto my back, and the mind of an executive in
   the Chinese corporation that has funded the arena has been bonded to
   mine in some way - he can see and feel everything I do, and can nudge
   me to do things that are against my nature.&nbsp; I am to fight the
   driver who was my friend - now there is just hatred.&nbsp; He has also
   been cybernetically modified, but in a different way - I don't know
   the details of his modification.&nbsp; The fight begins.  &nbsp; The
   dream ends.</p>

   <span class="title">23:20 - Come up and see me sometime</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>With the statistic that men think of sex every 30 seconds (or whatever the
   statistic actually is) I find it strange that I have never really mentioned
   anything sexual here. I think it's due to my fantasies being embarrassingly
   tame. I don't have fantasies involving 9 girls and an orangutang (I don't know
   what made me think of that - does anyone know what the Freudian significance
   of an orangutang is?)</p>
   
   <p>I am more likely to fantasise about holding a girl tight and kissing her -
   far further than I have ever gone in real life. Maybe sleep together, and when
   I wake up early, as I have a tendency to do, I would watch her sleep for a
   couple of hours, maybe get close enough to feel her breath on my face. This is
   all coming from the guy who was shocked awake when a girl asked to come back

   <p>Another day older - have I learned anything? Installing the FP
   server extensions is just as much of a bitch under Solaris as it is in
   Linux. Updated my match.com profile with an entry from this journal
   and a link to my web site. Hopefully people I scare will not email me
   before they get a chance to find out about me - two of the people I
   have responded too have never replied, and one wrote back to say I
   scared her. Not a good track record...</p>
   
   <p>Bumps on the pavement<br>
   A warning to the blind<br>
   They are in front of the yellow line<br>
   The sighted get more warning</p>
   
   <p>I wish the trains were more frequent through Greenwich - standing
   here waiting for the train in shoes that were comfortable a year ago
   but need replacing now - another sign of my apathy - I go out of my
   way to get a new Discman, but cannot be bothered to get an item as
   essential as new shoes.</p>
   
   <p>The pyramid flashes<br>
   Brightly<br>
   A repetitive warning<br>
   Beware</p>
   
   <p>A motionless train stands in the DLR. station, I wonder when they
   will wind it up and set it in motion.</p>
   
   <p>Why?</p>
   
   <p>Blue graffiti on the train seats has been painted over with pink
   paint. The graffiti beneath is still visible - why do they bother. Saw
   the pictures of last Friday today - I look almost happy in some of
   them. Some crazy lighting effects on many of them. I went to
   Centrepoint the next day and the setting of one of the photos had
   disappeared. Spooky.  Either a phantom doorway or I was looking in the
   wrong place. Considering the state I was in I know which one I am more
   likely to believe. Another 10 minutes standing on weary legs - why do
   they insist on not having enough seats - there are long unoccupied
   stretches of wall - one of which I am currently leaning against - how
   difficult would it be to put a couple of dozen seats here? It would
   not be enough for rush hour, but most other times of day there would
   be plenty of seats - it would certainly be useful for delays of an
   unspecified length - such as the one that has just been announced.</p>
   
   <p>Ignorance.<br>
   Bliss?<br>
   Not from my shoes.</p>
   
   <p>Mind a blank canvas<br>
   All thought out</p>
   
   <p>five minutes to my train - only seven minutes late. Hardly enough
   to notice. I'm surprised they even mentioned it - they wouldn't have
   usually. Two minutes later and it's still due in five minutes - when
   will I learn not to believe the signs - I guess I'm just naturally
   trusting. Believing. Gullible. Train's here. Time for a music change -
   something inspirational to get me off of the subject of trains before
   I bore everyone to tears. Some classic Electro pop - Violator by
   Depeche Mode. Reminds me of the school trip to Paris - the ferry from
   Dover - I stood on the deck in a light drizzle, content in my own
   melancholic manner. I was awake for the whole trip - I remember
   listening to this album and Suicidal Tendencies' Controlled by
   Hatred/Feel like Shit, Deja vu. The heavy emotions mix of How will I
   Laugh Tomorrow When I can't even smile today. I was in the middle of a
   huge crush on Sim Fletcher - I remember looking over her shoulder in
   the coach and reading her middle name (Louise) from her passport -
   harmless information, but I felt that I had discovered some big secret
   - this was before I sent her the Valentines card, the one with the
   poem, the one that had half of the school year in tears of laughter -
   that I had the audacity to declare my love for someone as beautiful as
   Simone - me, the fat brainy kid.  It still hurts now. She was OK about
   it, but her friends were total bitches. I was shown nothing but scorn
   while at school, but felt satisfied that I was getting higher marks
   than most of them. Am I any better off now? I probably earn more money
   than they do, but am I happier, am I more content in my life? I doubt
   it. My sister always has money troubles, but she has a partner and a
   beautiful son, with another child on the way. Money isn't the route to
   happiness - it just gives you more options to forget how bad things
   are. I really wish I'd had a drink tonight - it doesn't take the
   emptiness away, but it makes it more bearable. St Albans coming

   'til I'm high as God is. Skittish vision blinking, looking for a
   creepy, junky loving chick - coulda, woulda, shoulda had your flavour
   on a stick. The herd flocks over to platform 3 - don't they realise
   that the next train will be at platform 1 before the delayed one they
   are waiting for? More space on the train for those of us with a brain
   of our own. pretty brat sure knows where it's at, if you push her
   belly then her hair grows long - my sister had one of those dolls -
   pretty bizarre thing to have in a song lyric. A lot of the bands I

   I just not notice them until recently? Bright green sweatshirt -

   a couple of generations to find any lasting relationships - my
   parental grandparents were together until the end - but none of their
   children are still in their first marriage, on my mothers side you
   need to go back to my great grandfather - there are non-immediate
   family members of a more recent generation, but no-one that I am
   directly descended from. I hope this pattern can be broken - if only
   for my sister's sake. The tempo has dipped towards the end of the CD
   and my mood has dipped with it. Rain is falling outside. I get sick of
   myself sometimes - but there is no walking away. Rain on the river -
   it soothes briefly, but the train soon carries me past.  Get Some - by

   They will be back<br>
   That matters not<br>
   I am content<br>
   For now</p>
   
   <p>All hail Dog<br>
   Almighty deity<br>
   With silky coat <br>
   And healthy wet nose</p>
   
   <p>Pretend best friend. All that I've got.</p>
   
   <p>Under the lens<br>
   Scrutiny unending<br>
   Will I make the grade?<br>
   Will the darkness hide the scars?</p>
   
   <p>Reflections from a million facets<br>
   Mind like a shattered mirror<br>
   Beautiful in it's way<br>
   But flawed and worthless to most</p>
   
   <p>For sale - one soul<br>
   One careless owner<br>
   May be scarred beyond saving<br>
   Yours if you want it<br>
   If you fancy a challenge</p>
   
   <p>Hate - unfocussed energy - someone please be my lens - help me
   focus this hate into love.</p>
   
   <p>Sleep comes - ready to take me into her embrace. Carry me away to a
   better place. It will not last forever, but while we are together I
   will be happy.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>Almost time to check on the food. This is a very funny film it's so
   obvious that it is taken from the stage. As James Robinson once wrote
   in Starman - you know you're getting older when you start looking
   forward to the Harpo Harp solo... 20:36 - food is doing well - way
   need something to thicken it. I'll throw a handful of oats in at
   nine. There must be a better way to pass the time. Why can't I be
   bothered to get up off of my arse. Time to run a bath - it takes far
   too long - I wish we had a shower. The only time I can completely
   forget myself these days is while sleeping - even laying in bed
   watching a good movie I am thinking of other things. Hugging my pillow
   is comforting - but in a limited way - it can't hug back. I'm bored
   enough to dial in just to upload this update... I wonder if any more
   of my ICQ authorisation requests have been answered - it's a pain
   using the same number on multiple machines - you have to get
   authorisation for each machine - if you are on the wrong machine when
   they reply then you have to ask again. I have got all of the important
   ones authorised now anyway - the ones left to get authorisation from
   very rarely send me anything... Bath, Food, Bed - G'Nite.</p>

   <span class="title">20:02 - Matinee</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>Boredom has caught up again. I close my eyes and see couples
   entangled in a passionate embrace. Why does my mind have to torture
   me? Do I hate myself that much at a subconscious level? Lying on my
   bed hugging my pillows. I might turn my lava lamps on to watch - they
   take about an hour to warm up though. An old bloodstain on my
   pillowcase - everywhere there are reminders of the past - nowhere is
   there hope for the future. I am hungry, the music has stopped - I
   can't be bothered to get up and remedy either of these things. What is
   the point? What will change? I wish I could pull myself out of my self
   absorbtion for a while - I thought I had managed for a while on
   Friday, but I had just transferred it elsewhere. Instead of thinking
   about how lonely I was all night I distracted myself by writing
   everything down - I still wasn't paying any attention to the world
   around me - I was tied up in the world inside. I wasn't bored like I
   am now though. Or Hungry. Time for a little action, food - then back
   upstairs for some music.</p>
   
   <p>Hum of the microwave. I never cook any proper food anymore. Apathy
   is taking over my life. I'm going to cook one of my stews for later -
   just shove whatever I can find in a casserole dish and cook for a few
   hours on a low gas. Oven is warming while I eat my soup.  I will end
   up making enough to feed a small country - I'll have to eat it on my
   own though. I'll probably put too many spices in anyway, so no-one
   else would eat it even if they were here. A little TV - I know there
   will be nothing on before I look. Benny Hill was enough to keep me
   going while eating. I don't really need to see this much leg &amp;
   cleavage in the mood I'm in at the moment though, so I won't watch any
   more...</p>
   
   <p>Cooking time: meat first - mince, chicken thighs and a few rashers
   of bacon. Seasoning next - Cajun hot pepper sauce, Worcester sauce, a
   couple of cloves of garlic, a stock cube,coarse ground black pepper
   and a pinch of mixed herbs. Tomato puree and a tin of plumb tomatoes,
   a handful of rice. A handful of peas and top off with some milk &amp;
   water. Done. Now to put it in the oven for a few hours - checking
   every now and then to make sure it doesn't dry out (or to put
   something to thicken it if it doesn't dry out enough).</p>
   
   <p>Lava lamps are nearly warmed up - I think I'll lose myself in a few
   Marx brothers films - Animal Crackers, Monkey Business and A Night at
   the Opera sounds like a good combo. I wish you could get Duck Soup on
   video on this side of the Atlantic. I may have to order an NTSC copy -
   my video does NTSC playback on PAL.</p>

   <span class="title">13:55 - Interpretation</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>First reading. Question? Will my loneliness ease before the millennium?</p>
   
   <p>Using Celtic cross layout and all cards. The deck is the vertigo
   tarot, with very cool Dave McKean artwork.</p>
   
   <p>Significator: queen of swords (inv)<br>
   Crossing card: the fool<br>
   foundation: seven of pentacles (inv)<br>
   the past: four of cups (inv)<br>
   the crown: justice<br>
   the future: page of cups<br>
   emotions/feelings: two of wands<br>
   external influences: the empress (inv)<br>
   hopes/desires: the lovers (inv)<br>
   the outcome: the star</p>
   
   <p>OK, now for the interpretation. The outcome it the star - this
   gives the reading an overall feeling of hope and openness. The
   significator indicates my current state of mind - the reversed queen
   of swords indicates emotional turmoil - she can also indicate someone
   cruel or manipulative, but this is at odds with the outcome card. The
   fool indicates following your own path, wildness - taking risks, in
   the crossing position this can indicate that I am unwilling to take
   chances and that I do not trust my instincts. The foundation is an
   indicator of why I came to the cards reversed the meaning of the seven
   of pentacles is holding back from commitment or hard work without
   reward. The past position indicates something that has passed or is
   passing from my life - it can indicate something that I need to let go
   of before I can move on. The four of cups indicates apathy, boredom,
   loss through inaction. Reversed it indicates taking action or making a
   decision, preventing loss - in this position it could be interpreted
   as the time to make a decision will soon pass - or that it may already
   be too late to move forward without loss. The crown is the bridge
   between past &amp; future - it can indicate an issue being resolved or
   something happening now that has implications for the future. The
   justice card indicates honesty (especially honesty when looking at
   yourself) a passion for justice, or a fair outcome. Interpretation:
   being honest with myself will help me to achieve my objective.  The
   future card is an indicator of things that will be important in the
   future - the page of cups indicates someone imaginative, dreamy and/or
   reflective. Spending time allowing feelings to flow into awareness
   without judgement. Emotions/feelings signifies my inner emotional and
   psychological state - the two of wands indicates control, power,
   focused will - the ability to act. External influences - the role of
   others in my life - indicates how others feel about me (or how I
   believe them to feel) it can also indicate how they feel about the
   issue being queried. The empress reversed indicates emotional
   distance, detachment or thinking something through. Hopes, ideals,
   desires - my hopes for the issue at hand - the image I hold internally
   of the outcome - the lovers reversed indicates difficulties in
   relationships, opposition between people. The need to rebel.</p>
   
   <p>Wow - that took an hour and a half the film has just finished and
   all I saw were a few moments of nakedness &amp; gore. It's amazing how
   there is relatively little flexibility in the overall meanings of the
   cards, yet they can still be made relevant. Some of those cards were
   scarily accurate. I hope the overall feeling of hope was accurate -
   they are only cards though - what can a rectangle of card know of my
   future?</p>

   <p>Rain coming down hard outside. If I thought there was any chance of
   a girl coming back to my room it would be very different. A ring of
   jungle animals dancing around the outside - left from the previous
   occupant - I have no motivation to remove it. The death of supergirl
   poster - a touching shot of superman crying for his departed cousin -
   my own addition. There is almost zero floorspace - electronics next to
   stacks of books - a double bed, which it far too big for the room (but
   is sooo comfortable) - the heavens have opened up - I love this sound
   - my Darth Vader mug (black, not one of the dodgy metallic ones to
   commemorate the anniversary) watches from atop one of the four sets of
   bookshelves. It contains condoms bought in a moment of wishful
   thinking about 5 years ago. Waste of money - they will need to be
   thrown out soon. A random selection of items on the chest of drawers -
   in front of my CDs. Matches, vitamin pills, shower gel, a pipe, lemon
   juice, lighter fluid, a Stanley knife, a pile of bank statements and
   my new headphones. On the floor are strewn the last few months worth
   of Kerrang! and yesterdays clothes waiting to be put in the washing
   basket. Why am I writing this? Am I really this bored? I hate being
   alone. Will I ever have anything more? If anyone does want me then
   they would have to have a lot of patience to put up with me - it would
   take me a long to open up, I have an almost infinite capacity to not
   take hints - I have to be told directly or will never realise, I
   suspect that after if I do get into a relationship where I am
   comfortable I would be very clingy - but to get this far would mean
   getting past my paranoia and my belief that nothing good can ever
   last. What are my chances of finding someone who not only likes me,
   but could put up with all that?</p>
   
   <p>Why?</p>
   
   <p>Sometimes I just want to forget everything for a while. I'm scared
   to drink at home in case it becomes a habit. I wish there was a button
   I could push to just turn my mind off for a few hours.</p>
   
   <p>The disk filled up on the server earlier, so there will be a hole
   in the logs. This is like double voyeurism - people watch my innermost
   thoughts unfold - and I watch them watch. Bizarre.</p>
   
   <p>I think I'll dig my tarot cards out and do a couple of readings
   just to pass the time.</p>

   don't remember much.&nbsp; Some sort of secret agent thing where I
   developed telekinesis and was the only person who could save the world

   other peoples brains so that they could use telekinesis too.</p>
   
   <p>Rain falling outside - things are well and truly drenched.&nbsp;
   The temperature is just right, no waking up too hot last night.&nbsp;
   Watching the rain splash on the surface of the pond through my window
   is almost hypnotising.&nbsp; If I hadn't chopped the tree down a few
   weeks ago I wouldn't have noticed the effect. pit-pat pit-pat on the
   windowledge - I have bitched about the wet weather as much as anyone
   in the past, but at the moment I wouldn't have it any other way.&nbsp;
   Clouds are a uniform grey - no features to look at.</p>

   <p>Another vote to say I scare someone.&nbsp; I don't want to.&nbsp;
   Sometimes I just want to be 'normal', but I don't know how - and
   wouldn't be able to keep it up for long if I did.&nbsp; This is me, no
   matter how much I try to change, I always return to this. &nbsp; Not
   normal enough to fit with the mainstream, not weird enough to find
   comfort in the company of freaks - an outsider with nowhere to
   turn.</p>
   
   <p>I love the smell of wet trees.&nbsp; Not as good as the smell of
   wet dogs, or melted tar - but certainly one of the things that makes
   me feel strangely content.</p>

   <span class="title">06:53 - Apathatic</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>Black as the devil bitter as hell. Gaping hole all empty. I can't
   even save myself. Everything I touch I break - I wanna break you. Sip.
   Magnet with the wrong polarity. Man in tweed with a little leather bag.
   Woman with a bad perm. I bet they aren't lonely. Nothing repels more
   than a black soul. Cheer up you miserable git. Why should tomorrow be
   any different from yesterday? Dream last night mirroring reality. Like
   Willow's vowels. Apathy. Mind like a broken mirror. Darkest days. Is
   there light ahead?  Is it illusion? Is it an oncoming train about to
   crush me further into the ground. Hating myself doesn't help. I feel so
   useless... Why, after all this time, does it still feel the same. Will I
   ever get used to it? Nothing. It has changed - it used to hurt now it is
   just a numbness. Silently screaming. Anti noise headphones work - cut
   out most of the train noise. I keep breaking all the promises that I
   keep making to myself... I love this CD - not sure why, I haven't
   experienced what he's singing about - perhaps because it shows that life
   can be this bad in a relationship - not just before. Inside my shell I
   wait &amp; bleed. Black sleeves hide the scars. Fade to Black. Now I
   will just say goodbye.  Shallow empty shell. As good as dead - on the
   inside I'm dead already. With life is hope - why do I still believe
   things can be better? What proof have I seen. I won't become the thing I
   hate. never quit - keep going until it kills me. I fear things getting
   better - what of the inevitable fall back down - will I be higher or
   lower than now? Higher according to the bard. I still don't understand
   why I hope... Stubborn to the point of stupidity. Better the devil you
   know. I should record the good things here so that I remember them
    - but I don't notice them. Are they really not there or am I just too
   tied up in my own self-pity? Pretty woman in a summer dress - hurts just
   to look at her, but I keep looking back. What if I am alone forever? Is
   that my destiny? To die alone in a dingy flat with nothing but a one bar
   fire an a bottle of whiskey for company? Why do I get so depressed on
   the train? What's worse - to be alone on your own or alone in a crowd?
   Lots of votes in my last poll... The only person I scare is me.
   Sometimes I terrify myself. Many times I have curled myself into a ball
   and wished I was someone else - but I am me &amp; have to live with it -
   someone has to, after all. Motionless in a human tide, just the
   scritch-scratch of the stylus for company. I wish I could smalltalk and
   read between the lines but I function on logic - just the facts ma'am,
   just the facts. Irrelevant conversation annoys me while sober, and drunk
   my input is worthless. Time for a music break... Hmmm,irrelevant
   dialogue annoys me - but I can spend hours on irrelevant monologue. I
   sometimes wonder if this is just some bad dream and I will wake up
   content - but no-one could have a sick enough psyche to put themselves
   through this could they? Almost to work - time to lose myself in bigger
   concerns for a few hours. Maybe drink enough tonight for sweet oblivion
   to carry me away on her black wings...</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>Dream.&nbsp; A huge garden.&nbsp; I am there, so are my sister, my
   nephew Luke and my mother.&nbsp; It is blue sky overhead, but I don't
   remember it being particularly hot. &nbsp; There is a building nearby
   that I run, but I don't remember ever seeing the outside of it.&nbsp;
   There is a picnic table with a round green balloon floating over
   it.&nbsp; It is not tethered, but does not float away.&nbsp; I grab hold
   of it and it starts floating away with me hanging onto it. I float a
   long way down the garden and then the balloon pop and I fall to the
   ground.&nbsp; It is dark and I am surrounded by toys.&nbsp; I walk back
   to the end of the garden - I think it was a long way, but don't remember
   how long it took me to walk back.&nbsp; I have staff waiting in the
   building for me, I stay outside for the moment though.&nbsp; These staff
   may be fragments of a previous dream, incorporated into this
   one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The green balloon has reappeared above the table.&nbsp;
   Luke grabs it, but it doesn't have enough lift to float him more than a
   centimetre or so above the ground - it was able to lift me 5 feet from
   the ground - maybe it lifts more for people who weigh more.&nbsp; I am
   stung on the leg by a wasp that gets caught in a crease in my
   jeans.&nbsp; I go inside and am in a large pub, which I am the manager
   of.&nbsp; My staff are here, 1 male, 2 female.&nbsp; I don't remember
   their names or what they look like - I do remember that I fancy one of
   the female ones though.&nbsp; I find it very difficult to talk to her
   and I think she gets the impression that I am ignoring her.&nbsp; I pay
   them their wages with change from the till.&nbsp; That's as much as I
   remember.</p>

   <p>Forgot to buy Kerrang! yesterday, so there's probably not going to be

   <p>Offsite meeting today. I'm going to be really early I think, but I
   don't know for sure how long it will take to get there. If I am early I
   can always write another entry to pass the time :)</p>
   
   <p>Wasn't that much in Kerrang! this week - the article about Charles
   Manson's influence on modern rock will probably be interesting, but I
   can't be bothered to read it now. Looks likes silence feeds my apathy. I
   have got to get a new discman. I think I'm going to just buy a new one -
   I'll get the other one repaired eventually - I could probably use it for
   a birthday present for someone in the family - saves it going to
   waste...  Bugger - I've just remembered that it's Mum's birthday this
   month. Ignore me - it's not until October - I must be going insane (or
   more insane than I am already anyway...)</p>
   
   <p>I hate sport. It's fun to play, sometimes anyway, but I have no
   interest in watching most sports - but it is impossible to get away
   from. According to the radio this morning the average wage for scottish
   professional footballers is \xa350M - wtf?</p>
   
   <p>I am feeling terrible this morning - I had no problem getting up, but
   now I just want to curl up and go to sleep. The beginnings of a headache
   and the wet heat is back. Yay. Is there an opposite to an exclamation
   mark? I guess :( would fill that role online, but is there anything to
   imply that in RL? I find it hard to believe that written language has
   been around for so long and has not had a way of indicating sarcasm
   until the birth of the Internet. End of the line. TTFN</p>

   station (the food was all chicken, but it wasn't a KFC).&nbsp; I was so
   drunk that I couldn't read the menu to decide that I wanted.&nbsp; They
   were frying eggs and kept having to throw them away because they had
   broken the yolk.&nbsp; I was floating and had to concentrate very hard
   to stay on the ground.&nbsp; When I was coming down from the platform to
   the concourse I was hanging onto the hand rail and my feet were floating
   in the air above my head.&nbsp; A bloke came up to me while I was
   struggling to keep hold of the handrail, and my drunkeness combined with
   my struggling caused me to completely ignore him - he wandered off
   saying something about me not having a watch, my watch was clearly
   visible though...</p>

   <p>Right, where was I? Who knows? Who cares? What is the point? Let's
   pick a front-page story at random from someone else's paper for me to
   rant about... Well, well - so the queen mum is 99 today - does that
   story really need half of the front page of a broadsheet paper? It's
   depressing to think about the fact that I could have another 75 years of
   this to go - and at the end I could end up like great granddad Chaffey -
   at least I won't have the pain caused by forgetting the names of my
   visitors, because I won't have any ... Thinking of how upset GGC used to
   get when he would know who my mum was, but couldn't remember her name is
   both upsetting to remember and also quite scary - things can get worse
   than they are now, and they probably will. I fixed a laptop yesterday,
   the main reason I succeeded was that I wasn't afraid to make things
   worse because I know that sometimes you need to make something worse
   before it gets better... I hope I don't have to apply that to my
   personal life - it's bad enough as it is. Maybe I have already been
   applying that principle subconsciously - that could be what my brief
   experiment in self mutilation was about... it didn't work though. The
   scars are fading slowly, the ones on my upper left arm are probably
   going to be permanent, but at least they aren't as visible now - you'll
   only be able to see them up close soon - I'm glad I kept the cuts above

   that's 2 stops closer - don't know why I bothered really, it hasn't
   reduced the journey time at all...  The train I'm after is 7 minutes
   late - I might not be able to get a coffee at all :( I'm gonna look
   around here (Blackfriars) and see if I can find a coffee shop... Yay! 
   They even do flavoured latte - he's put far too much cinnamon syrup in
   though :( Now I'm back to the drink or write dilemma. A palmtop that you
   could sub-vocalise to - or even one with thought recognition, that would
   make this journal really easy - it would also enable me to do the dream
   diary part. I really want to do that while I'm awake, but can never be
   bothered to write them down when I wake up :(</p>
   
   <p>Apparently the train was delayed by a crash in Mill Hill - it was
   less than 10 mins late, so it can't have been a very bad crash... Maybe
   the train-driver was just rubber-necking at a crash on the motorway. Lol
   - this thing just wrote rupert instead of rubber. Rupert-necking, I
   guess that must have something to do with wearing a scarf - I don't want
   to think about it too much though...</p>
   
   <p>Ack! My CD player has just given up on me - no music until I can dig
   out the receipt and take it back!!! That will be the weekend at the very
   earliest.  Expect some seriously pissed off entries over the next 2-3
   days...</p>
   
   <p>Almost to Greenwich... Signing off...</p>

   <span class="title">22:14 - Gone</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p>Why do people constantly imitate others?&nbsp; I may not be the most
   innovative of people, but at least when I do something unoriginal it is
   because I am acting onunprovoked impulse - not because I have seen
   someone else do something and feel that I have to out do them.</p>
   
   <p>The air is clear tonight - I may actually be able to sleep through
   without waking up tangled in sweat soaked sheets.</p>
   
   <p>Another couple of hits from match.com today - I wonder if they'll
   reply after reading this or if they'll quietly disappear... No emails
   from Erin for about a week - I guess she's finally had enough of
   me.&nbsp; No matter - my email conversation with her really helped me to
   open up.&nbsp; If only I can follow through in RL.&nbsp; Would have been
   nice to talk to her some more though :(</p> 
   
   <p>I need to bring &quot;River of Blue Fire&quot; into work tomorrow
   because Matt wants to borrow it (just a note to remind myself when I
   transfer this entry to the web when I get home)</p>
   
   <p>The computer displays in rail stations are great.&nbsp; According to
   the boards my train will be second on this platform, and will be
   arriving a minute before the train in front of it.&nbsp; Time travelling
   trains would be cool - I could get home before I leave. &nbsp; I would
   never have times for these ramblings though - probably a service to
   mankind, but it would deprive me of an emotional outlet and I would go
   back to bottling it all up inside.&nbsp; Ah, an announcement to say my
   train is 6 minutes late, that's more like it.</p>
   
   <p>What would I do if I had an extra two and a half hours a day by
   cutting the travel out? &nbsp; I'd probably spend the time working, or
   watching utter crap on TV.&nbsp; I'd probably play large amounts of
   EverQuest - at least that contains an element of socialising (if played
   at the right time - otherwise it's safer to play solo to avoid the
   kewlios)</p>
   
   <p>Why is it that I still like so much stuff that most people grow out
   of?&nbsp; I read comics, I read high fantasy novels, I would love to
   start playing pen &amp; paper RPGs again, I listen to Heavy Metal music
   (the phrase isn't exactly right, and has a ton of negative connotations
   - but I still like it)&nbsp; An explanation I have thought of in the
   past and find quite amusing is that maybe it's a hormone thing and
   because I am still a virgin I still have a teenage body chemistry.&nbsp;
   It's amazing the sort of pseudo scientific bullshit that you come up
   with when you have too much time on your hands.</p>
   
   <p>I really like Switchblade Symphony - I have only had this CD (Bread
   &amp; Jam for Frances) for 4 days and must have listened to it at least
   20 times, that's nearly 3 hours per day spent listening to it.&nbsp; Her
   voice is amazing - I can't believe that there is a line in one of the
   songs &quot;I don't sound good&quot; - umm, excuse me?&nbsp; Who the
   f*ck could possibly think that?</p>
   
   <p>I changed my email signature again today - only on my personal
   account though - the work address is still using a quote from Temple of
   Love by Sisters of Mercy.&nbsp; The new quote is from the Jack off Jill
   track Devil with a Black Dress on - &quot;Do you wanna hurt me angel,
   'cause I'm hurting now you're gone&quot; - I love that track.</p> <p>I
   love writing this down as stream of consciousness - it's fun to go back
   and think &quot;Wow, do my thoughts really flit about like
   that?&quot;.&nbsp; In reality they flit about even more - but the text
   recognition on my Palm can't keep up - I have a half dozen thoughts
   while I'm trying to finish a sentence.&nbsp; The constant shaking of the
   train doesn't help either - I have to go back to correct the mistakes,
   otherwise I wouldn't know what the hell I had written.</p>

   <p>Soundtrack is &quot;Sleep no more&quot; by Comsat Angels. Maybe if I
   forced myself to listen to cheerful chart music it would actually make
   me start feeling cheerful - I don't think I'll try as it is more likely
   to end with a violent act - if I were to kick my amplifier my widescreen
   TV will have to wait even longer (should have enough by next payday -
   unless I spend too much on crap - like I usually do)</p>
   
   <p>Bored. I really hate trains. It is hot &amp; humid again, I am
   sweating and have the beginnings of a headache. I'm only about half way
   to work - doesn't bode well...</p>
   
   <p>The ESP feature of Sony Discman portable CD players is complete crap
   - I used to get far better uninterrupted playback on my Technics before
   the volume control broke - the Sony one has the benefit of an extra 2
   years of R&amp;D - well done Sony. It's only about 3 months old - I
   can't really justify getting a new one just because this one skips too
   much :(</p>

   <p>I wish I could find something light to think about but my thoughts
   are all tainted by darkness. Everywhere I look I see couples, sitting
   facing a happy couple on the train is one of the things I most dread.
   The unattainable right in front of my face. In the past I have been told
   that I just need to get laid - I don't think this is the answer though -
   I can live with virginity - all I want is someone that can be there to
   smile and hold me tight when I am down - someone that I can be there for
   to do the same.  But how can I find someone - certainly not by thinking
   these black thoughts - which brings me full circle. I wish I could find

   it.&nbsp; An ache permeates my soul - I long for understanding, but
   expect none.&nbsp; I am slipping into poetry, even in prose. &nbsp; Do I
   do this because I enjoy it - or because I have recieved positive

   <p>Why must I be destructive when I drink?&nbsp; Recently it has been
   self focused (apart from one noticable exception).&nbsp; The only way I
   can see to avoid this is to give up drinking.&nbsp; This would remove
   the only contact I have with the world - and remove the moments of
   waking oblivion where I can actually enjoy life.</p>

1999-08-02 07:10 - Hmmm, time for a dream diary entry methinks...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starts with me as an external observer watching a town using high tech bows and
arrows (fire laser bolts) to repel an invasion by flying energy beings.
The energy beings begin to fly away, and I follow. Once we are out of
sight of the town the energy beings land and transform into a group of female
warriors. As they walk across the land they come across strange buildings
which are built partly under ground. They find a semi-detached house in
the middle of a moor and decide to move in. One of the amazons gets into
and argument with the others, I think it is because she feels sorry for
attacking the town earlier. I can't remember how, but I enter the scene
and start to try and save the one with a conscience (I am not sure what I am
saving her from, but this is a dream and doesn't need to make sense).
After they kill me several times while making rescue attempts and I am
mysteriously resurrected each time I finally make it to the door of the room
where she is sleeping by shinning up the banister (there were no stairs for
some reason). I am just about to enter her room and try to convince her
to leave when another door on the hallway opens and one of the amazons comes
out and sees me. Her war cries bring the others out and just before I am
overwhelmed by their numbers I say &quot;I am only trying to save her!&quot;
and suddenly they stop attacking me. I think they saw me as some sort of
religious figure who had come to save her soul. That's when I woke up.

That one was bizarre even for me.

| In darkness I am whole
| The deep night soothes my pain
| Wrap me in your black wings
| Sweet darkness take me home

1999-08-01 19:30 - Not yet thin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Final update for today... Ween's &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; playting in
the background.

Over the past week or so I have been trying to be more open about my emotions -
rather than bottling them up inside and leaving them to ferment.  It seems to
be having interesting effects.  I have had questions about my health, personal
advice and plain old sympathy.  It's probably too early to hope that this is
going to lead me out of the darkness that has plagued me for so long, it is
making me feel relatively positive at the moment though...

1999-08-01 17:55 - Novelty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wow, two updates on the first day - won't be able to keep that up for long ;)

I hate this heat. I have been sitting in front of the screen sweating
all day. I wish it could be night eternally - there is no time I feel more
content than when walking in a light drizzle in the early hours of the morning
- the only thing in my experience that competes is sitting on a beach at night
- nothing but the sound of waves on the shore. I wish there was enough
space in my room to get an air conditioning unit, but there is far too much
stuff crammed in here already.
   
| Wet heat
| Drowning in mediocrity
| Soul screaming in pain
| But all is silent
   
I really have to get a life - but I have no idea where to look and I
wouldn't know what to do with it if I had one anyway.

1999-08-01 09:29 - Poetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sitting here listening to "Bread and Jam for Frances" by
Switchblade Symphony I have felt the urge to write some poetry for the first
time in ages... Haven't got anything polished, but here are some
fragments...

| Emptiness is all I feel
| Why must I be so alone?
| Is it me?

| This emptiness blackens my soul
| Soon to be void, an empty hole
| The blackness spreads
| And I know not how to halt the advance
| Before I am a mere husk
| Blindly going through habitual motions
| In an imitation of life

| My heart is numb
| Except for the dull, throbbing ache of loneliness

| What is there to keep me here?
| Who is there that cares?
| Why do I keep going?
| Please tell me the point.

| Mediocrity
| Emptiness
| Pain
| Life.

I think I shall sleep now - not because I am tired, but because it will grant
me a few hours of sweet oblivion.>
