22:20 - Give me an iPod
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warning: link to site with potential scam affilliations ahead. The "Free" iPods
on offer at ipods.freepay.com aren't as free as they'd like to make out. But
you can get one for a lot less outlay than it'd otherwise cost if you're
careful.

Basically you have to sign up for some additional service (along the lines of a
rental service subscription, or a dvd club type service). You will have to
spend, but you can qualify by spending under 100 quid, which is a damn site
less than you'd pay for the iPod.

Some of the promotions have a distinct scam-like whiff, so be careful to read
the small print.

Here's the link again
