I am Zeppo without the looks or voice. Groucho without the
wisecracks. Square peg.  Chocolate teapot. Outsider. Geek. Freak. We
are society - surrender and be assimilated. A borg like assimilation
would be good - at least afterwards I would fit. Would know my
place. Enough.

She shines in a world full of ugliness, she matters when everything is
meaningless. A pearl of beauty in an ocean of pain. I wonder if any of
Trent's songs are still genuine - he has loadsa money and is well
respected in the music industry, loads of loyal fans. Can he still be
as twisted as his music makes out? Probably, I am an example of this
happening - I have a job I like (some of the time anyway), earn decent
money, have the respect of other people (when it comes to technical
matters) - and yet am I happy? Am I fuck.

   The new NIN album - he's still full of instantly meaningful lines. All the spoils of a
   wasted life - all of this for you. Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore.Too fucked up to care
   any more. The good points aren't as good as the good points of the downward spiral - but
   the low points aren't as low as the spiral either. No instant classics like closer or
   heresy unfortunately. I am a very sick puppy - why else would I like songs like closer and
   girlscout by jack off jill. Still no news about the new album. Major pisser - afaik they
   finished recording ages ago - I wonder in the record company has lost faith, or run out of
   money... Time for work.</p>

   <p>I am such a sad fuck. Pouring my ever effort into an RPG like a spotty school kid.
   Reality is too hard to cope with, so I bury myself in a fantasy world. Cry me a river. Get
   a life? Tell me where from and I'll happily give it a try, as long as I don't have to try
   too hard - I am a lazy bastard after all. What matters to me? Drink. Computers. Films.
   Music. Comics. Got the Marx brothers movies that I ordered about two months ago yesterday
   - Yay! Almost watched them last night, but managed to stop myself. Still played EQ for an
   hour though - made level three in one hour of play time - almost one hour dead, but had to
   rest before the final Gnoll pup and made 1:01 in the end. Found a backpack and small box
   on mobs, saved me quite a bit of money. Always I hide. Behind the masks so long that even
   I don't know what is behind them anymore. If there is anything. Am I just a void hiding
   behind a china mask, one tap and I shatter wholey. What the fuck am I talking about?
   Running off at the mouth again. I am lost, and no-one can find me because no-one is
   looking. Like a brick at the bottom of a lake - there are plenty of them to find, but
   there are much more interesting things to see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>I think I'm going to start over in EverQuest again - Barbarian warrior named Wolfbiter
   - based on the character from The Gilded Chain by Dave Duncan - I think the character was
   a rapier man - could limit weapon choices - either use a sheild or dual-weild a
   main-gauche. Dual weild is better - barbarians get to bash wlthout a sheild due to their
   size. Cool. Lots of people have commented on my being clean shaven - the two most common
   comments have been &quot;It looks different&quot;, or &quot;you look younger&quot; - very
   non-commital statements - implies that the general concensus is that I made a mistake
   shaving the beard off. Fair enough. I am going to have to start this character off
   tonight, I don't have the will power to wait until tomorrow. I'll have to try not to be up
   too late - a target of level 3 is probably not too far out - probably won't be able to
   flesh the character out much - all points into dex and agi. I'll probably not bother with
   head armour, so I don't need to put up with the polar bear head. Another good reason not
   to use a sheild is the fact that there is a bug in the barbarian graphics file and sheilds
   don't show up. Game limitations are secondary though - mainly I just want to keep in
   character for the vision I have. I lose some pretty important skills by going for warrior,
   but if I team I should be pretty damn funky. No bind is a bitch, but life sucks, so who's
   counting? With dual weild, double attack, dodge, parry, riposte and critical hits I get to
   be a pretty mean damage machine. Soloing isn't really an option before too long - I'll
   need to group a lot. Have to overcome my anti-social tendencies. How likely is that?</p>

   <p>So much for that plan. No copies at either EB on Oxford St. the tube is buggered now
   too. If it doesn't start moving soon I'm going to be late. An hour to get from Oxford
   Circus to Greenwich is pushing it. Ahh, motion. Emotion. Heh, there are people getting off
   at TCR - it would have been much quicker to walk. Stopped again. Read a pretty amusing
   article on the net about why geeks make good lovers the other day - some of it was so true
   to me that it was scary, the stuff about Trek was out though - I obviously don't qualify
   as a Net geek as to me Trek is just another show to me. Train has bqoken down, oh joy.
   Looks like I'm definately going to be late. Back to the geek thread... In some ways
   according to the article I must be some form of ï¿½bergeek. Most computer geeks can open up
   in online chat much easier than RL - not I, e-mail and usenet are fine - chat is a
   definate no-no though. I wonder why I am like this, it is a pain in the arse. Sitting on
   the floor at Charing cross waiting for the Greenwich train to come up on the board.
   Ho-hum. I never start the conversation, someone else always does that part. My leg it
   going to sleep, I wish they would hurry up and announce the train so that I can sit in a
   real seat. On the train, about to leave. Do I actually come to any conclusions with these
   ramblings? Nothing I didn't know before. There is something about me that repels the thing
   I seek, I have known that for a long time - I just don't know what that thing is. I
   actually find myself wanting to be hurt by someone close to me sometimes - for that to
   happen someone would have to be close to me. Something I want but seem incapable of
   acheiving. Can emotional logic be formalised? Pairings of states - said(meant) - gives
   possibilities true(true), true(false), false(true) and false(false) - it's a case of
   knowing the hidden state when there are no clues. Why am I even bothering to write this -
   it has no basis in fact - I have never even been deep enough in a relationship to even say
   hello to the other person, or to even let the other person even know that I have seen that
   they exist. If I make eye contact I quickly look away and pretend it never happened - keep
   my eyes averted for a good five-ten minutes. Doing everything wrong, because that is what
   feels most right.</p>

   <p>Good game last night. Got to level 4 in about 4 hours. Got a fairly good skill in
   tailoring and have about three quarters of a set of patchwork armour. Bit of a time clash
   with Andy again - I didn't realise what was happening as he wasn't on ICQ, so I didn't
   know he was around. I'm buying him a copy of the game on the way to work, and he can pay
   me back. I'll help him twink the new character with his old stuff. He'll certainly be the
   toughest level 1 around. We can sneak some money/stuff through BB to my character at the
   same time. I'll need to use my Enchanter's Invisibility spell to get Andy through and
   back.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p>Got the Everquest bug again. Brief respite only. Want to get level 8, but BB will be
   way packed at this time. I might get lucky. If not I'll try my luck in the Karanas - I
   managed to find and defeat a white spider yesterday, but cocked things up by trying to
   make a tunic with only one swatch of silk - I should have tried a one swatch item, such as
   gloves or sleeves. Come to think of it the spiders will probably be well hunted - plenty
   of people know how to make silk armour. Spiders are a bit tough for my level anyway -
   poison is a bitch - I need another couple of levels. Or a companion. Low level monk would
   be ideal. If I could find Matty online his tracking would come in very useful. I need
   another level and a bucket full of cash before I am worth any real good in a party. Level
   8 spells are far too expensive. I think I left some stuff in a no rent container
   yesterday. Hope I didn't lose all of my sewing patterns. I think I had about 80 of them -
   that's about 5pp worth - that's a good couple of hours of play time to get back. Maybe I
   do need to hunt BB for a couple of hours after all. Should get me to level 8 no problems.
   Should have enough money to buy one spell when I level - what should I go for? I could go
   for charm, but my charisma is not high enough for it to stick for long - I think root is
   one of the options - could be handy, but I don't have any DD spells yet - I guess I should
   get Sanity Warp first. Being a magic user requires far too much thinking - maybe I shoula
   go back to the beginning and start a Monk - or a Barbarian Shaman - I was always quite
   fond of my Ogre Shaman - the tells for SoW will probably be annoying - but that's quite a
   way off yet. Talk about thinking ahead - lol. Very tempting. Should I do it now or wait
   for Andy to get a copy of EQ? I will start tonight. Decision made. Keelta (hope that
   name's not taken) can take up tailoring at level 1 and have full patchwork by level 4.
   Everfrost is a way cool place to start tailoring. I don't know of anywhere else that gives
   such an abundance of the right size pelts in the newbie zone. Nice amount of quests too -
   just need to whack a few gnolls and the people of Qeynos will love me. Unfortunately I get
   that dodgy polar bear skin hat. The right look for a barbarian shaman though, so it's not
   too bad. The leather kilt is definately questionable. The Jean-Paul Gaultier of the frozen
   north. Hope there aren't too many vengeful skeletons out tonight - they can be a right
   bitch. I should be able to make level 3 at least - hopefully level 4 - before the night is
   over. No meditate! Going back to natural mana regaining is going to be a nightmare. First
   level spells aren't too bad with the shaman - a dd, a heal, and a couple of decent buffs.
   I know the zone pretty well too (the canyons part, anyway - I've never really been high
   enough level to explore the tundra much). The train is back. Almost time to fight.</p>

   <p>Don't get me wrong - I really appreciate the fact that they have toilets on trains - I
   just wish they cleaned them more regularly. Sitting here listening to the Wonder Stuff
   singles album with the smell of stale urine permeating the air. Face feels cold - the
   beard served utilitarian purposes as well as aesthetic ones. I want to be truly happy -
   just for a moment - to see what it's like. Headache doesn't help. Optimistic defeatist.

   <p>Blood pressure up again - 164/96. I've got to go to the hospital for a blood test - see
   the nurse for an ECG, and the Doctor has referred me for a 24 hour blood pressure check. I
   am a sick puppy. In many ways. And the crowd roars &quot;you fat bastard!&quot;. Cheery
   songs from the new Type O Negative album to keep me happy. Free coffee this morning - Yay!
   Track day on Friday has renewed my interest in buying a Caterham 7. It was definately the
   most fun car to drive. The Elise was quite nice, but was much heavier and had a very stiff
   throttle. It was just as difficult to get in and out of too. And more expensive and a
   longer waiting list. The Audi S4 was very nice to drive too. Looks like the train will be
   packed this morning. Bugger. At the wrong end of the train, but at least I have got a
   seat. My head is going to explode. Who wants to live forever - certainly not I. Shopping
   list - System Shock 2, Blue Velvet on DVD. I won't get Blue Velvet until I check the BBFC
   (Board of Butchers and Fanatical Censors) site - if there are any cuts then I will get the
   region 1 disc. There isn't likely to be a commentary - David Lynch doesn't like analysing
   his films - he prefers others to build their own opinion of them. Probably no other extras
   either - just a high quality copy of the movie. My VHS copy is Pan &amp; Scan - it'll be
   good to have it in widescreen. I won't bother going into town if all I want is SS2 - I'll
   pick it up at London Bridge - or wait until Thursday. Is the illusion of normality a good
   or bad thing? The freak has to be let off the leash every now and then - otherwise it will
   burst out when you're not looking. I know that from past experience. Does the mask serve
   any purpose? Should I just be my miserable, self-depreciating self 24-7? Would it do any
   harm? Probably not - but I am too set in my ways - there is no way I will be letting the
   mask slip. Latex smile hides pain and anger inside. I wish that I was more superficial.
   That I could feel comfortable issuing shallow pleasantries with people. That I had an
   inflated sense of self-importance and could go up and talk to strangers and feel like I
   was granting them a favour by doing so. It would make me a total wanker, but I wouldn't be
   physically lonely, and would have no need for mental companionship. Lonliness doesn't
   matter if you are happy with your own company. I am not. If I am not, why would anyone
   else be?</p>

   - an ocean of mediocrity with an occaisional island of pain. Rare enjoyment - such as the
   track day on friday - not so rare drunkeness, anaesthetic. Void. The mask slips while
   writing. Who is the real me. If the mask is worn for too long does it become reality.
   Where do I belong? Do I belong anywhere? It doesn't feel like it. Chris asked me whether

   stuff like budget projections. I seem to spend about half of my time reviewing CVs or

   numbers. At least I understand numbers. I am good with them. Unlike emotions - which I
   don't understand and my only skill with them is reading them wrong. I really should give
   up on this thread - it is never going to lead anywhere - but one of my faults is never
   knowing when the horse is dead - keep on flogging it way beyond the point where it is
   doing any good. I hate it when people look at me. It makes me feel paranoid. I guess I
   should make an effort to look more normal - to blend in to the crowd - no-one would look
   twice at the ugly fat bastard in a crowd - but when you add my goatee and tuft you add
   instant amusement factor. Look at the weirdo with the comedy hair - is that his real gut -

   What is wrong with me? Why did I get short changed when emotional sensitivity was handed

   with a vengeance. It's mainly just the sore throat left, with a bit of a cough. Mercifully
   the headache has eased off. I am losing interest in this diary. It was very useful during
   the down patch I had a little while ago, but now I am not as down. Is that true - or am I
   just bottling it up again? I am certainly not as bad as I was a while back, but I am not
   exactly mr happy. I wonder if losing some weight will help with my love life. I doubt it.
   I am going to go for it anyway - for medical reasons. To get back to normal weight for my
   height I need to go down to twelve stone. I've not weighed that since school. I wonder
   whether the electric shock exerciser will work or if it is just a waste of money. I hope
   it does - otherwise I may have to start exercising outside - with all the taunts from
   young children that entails. I hate being alone. I wonder if anything real can ever live
   up to the rose-tinted fantasies I have. Does true love exist? Probably, but I am never
   going to know it. Maybe I should move into a job in the banking industry with a 50-100%
   salary increase and find a gold digger who will pretend to love me. Or if she can't
   stretch it that far she could just pretend to like me. That would be an improvement on
   now. I wish I was a more likeable person. I don't like being an arsehole, but it is the

   longer hurt. No longer care. Don't want to commit suicide, so I wish for the end of the
   world. Wishful thinking the Russell way. Nothing lasts forever. Usually used as a negative
   statement, but I find that I can draw hope from it. Want. &quot;When you do find someone
   it will be forever&quot;. Tracy said that last night. I wish I could belleve that. She
   used the word when - not if. She obviously has more confidence in me than I do. I can't
   even keep penpals for more than about 3 emails. I wish people would tell me why they don't
   like me instead of walking away in silence.</p>

   <p align="left">On a stick. Wobbling in the middle of the carriage. I hate it when there
   are no seats. Thinking about doing a new website. I currently have a domain that is just
   redirecting to my existing site. Not sure exactly what to put on it, I've never been
   particularly good at doing content for sites. I just write random crap and catalogues of
   info that no-one is interesed in - not even me. A useless catalogue is probably how I will
   start - all the Vampire books, films, comics, games, merchandise, etc. that I have. Will
   take a while to just get that done - if I put scans up even longer. I wonder if I will
   ever get round to any content, or if I will get bored before I get around to it... Watched
   the first two episodes of the Manga &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; last night, as well
   as rewatching the first two episodes of Buffy and also watching Blade. A real Vamp night.
   The interviews on the new Buffy tapes were pretty disappointing - the interview with David
   Boreanaz on the second tape is almost the same as the one on the first tape, but with
   are doing it with Red Dwarf, so maybe I'll be lucky - the seasons of Red Dwarf are a lot
   shorter though :( I have been seriously bitten by the DVD bug - Dolby Digital surround
   film on DVD. Blue Velvet in 5.1 surround - yum. Or Lost Highway. No coffee in Quick Snack
   - what the fuck is that all about? I have to go elsewhere for this morning's second dose
   of caffeinated goodness. It's a good job there are so many coffee shops at London Bridge -
   otherwise I wouldn't be arriving at work with a caffeine high - and that would be very not
   good. In fact it would suck. (note to self - I have been watching waay too much Buffy
   recently - it's starting to infect my speech patterns...)</p>

   born between five and half past. Mum will call later with more details - she's not allowed
   in to visit until seven - so the next hour will probably be spent on the phone, she'll be
   too fidgety to just sit and wait. I wish we had more minor hardware installs to do - I was
   finished a quarter to six, and I'll be home by seven - if I had stayed in the office I
   probably wouldn't have left until half seven - possibly not even until half nine -
   probably would have gone for a drink if that was the case. Finally finished the book today
   - interesting end, not sure it needed the bit about the no-ship leaving for another
   universe or the face dancer god figures. What shall I read next? Probably the new
   Otherland book. My boots are almost worn in now. My feet ache, but it's not too bad.
   Wearing low top shoes for the past year has got rid of the callouses on my ankles - it
   will take a while for them to reappear. I wonder if any of the parcels I am expecting
   arrived today? I hope I get back in time for the post office if any did. I think the major
   ones are open until half eight. That may just be me mixing up opening and closing times
   though... I am sure that I picked up a comics delivery from Southampton sorting office
   after dark once. That could have been in winter when it gets dark early though. I'm going

   <p align="left">Not much diary this weekend - too much reading and everquesting. Cooking
   eggs now - not going to play EverQuest while doing that - last time I ruined the pan -
   boiling eggs for four hours tends to do that... I am so crap at the moment - haven't got
   dressed all weekend - I planned to do some stuff yesterday, but didn't even leave the
   house. One of the books I bought on Thursday was the wrong one - I don't know how, but I
   managed to pick up the wrong one from the shelf, walk around the shop with it in my hand
   for at least ten minutes and then didn't even notice at the checkout. It's an author I've
   heard good things about - so it's not a total disaster - but it reinforces my opinion that
   I am too dumb to be wandering the streets alone. That has to be one of the worst internal
   justifications for why I need someone to be with ever. Randomness is my trade. Chaos. How
   can I be so impulsive and so resistant to change at the same time? Impulsiveness could be
   a good thing - it could be exciting - but I leave the good part out and just do dumb stuff
   for no reason. I like being who I am, but I can't think of any reasons why - is it just my
   resistance to change saying &quot;be who you are - you know where you stand - there is no
   risk - you are comfortable&quot;? Longer entry than I was expecting to write - cool. I was
   ok, but now I feel empty. I think I will bury myself in a book again. I may even manage to
   finish it today. Help - I'm a prisoner in a boredom factory. Apathy's lament - you may
   think it's bad now, but just wait and see how bad it gets when you try and change things.</p>

remember much of how the evening ended. Just remember the early parts. A good
night - maybe.

I want to fuck up everything you've ever loved.

1999-09-03 07:07
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not quite right. I never am. I'll go in anyway - it only makes sense - I am at
the station already. Missed the earlier train because I was daydreaming back at
home. No northern line yet, AFAIK. Will go to Farringdon and sit there until
the right train arrives. I could get on the central line and go halfway around
town - I can't be bothered. I could walk to Blackfriars, but likewise. Drinkies
tonight. I could use one.

Thu, 02 Sep 1999
----------------

1999-09-02 21:06
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A walk to aid digestion. And to wear in my new boots. Ready for bed
now - for sleep.

1999-09-02 17:46
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thank god for loos on public transport. If only they would keep the
paper stocked. It's a good job I bought shoes earlier and they were
packed with tissue paper.  Another random thought: does the universe
have a charge? If it started from nothing then I guess not, but what
happens as a result of black hole radiation? If an electron-positron
pair are created by a vacuum fluctuation and the positron is sucked
into a black hole before they can annihilate what happens? I guess
that as time slows down as you get closer to the singularity it would
actually take an infinite amount of time to get there - this would
mean that the charge would still be in the universe keeping things
balanced...

1999-09-02 17:29
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spree over - time to go home. What excellent timing - central rush
hour. I suck. Need the loo again. Still not quite right. I think this
is the first pair of DMs that I have owned from new. Moleskin jeans -
very comfy. Shirts will show up all sorts of stains - didn't get
black - I should have. Another book, not one of the ones I intended to
buy. More videos - I can't resist special offers. No CDs, I must have
a little will power after all.


1999-09-02 15:27
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have been reading the same book for well over a month. Under normal
circumstances I would finish in about three or four days. Normal
circumstances? Is there such a state? Not that I can remember. It
would be more correct to say that for a period of about a year running
up until some point in early August I would have read that book in
about three to four days. Correctness can be a pain in the arse. My
back aches, I think I need to rotate the mattress on my bed.

1999-09-02 15:09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Random thought: Is Britney Spears' name spelt that way because her
parents were illiterate rednecks that couldn't spell Brittany? My head
circumference is just over 24", which makes my hat size XXL on an
online hat store. A big head and no self confidence - a living
oxymoron. I wish the volume dial on these headphones wasn't so easy to
knock. I may go on another book hunt today - according to amazon there
are about 5 books in Kristine Kathryn Rusch's fey series - I have only
ever seen the first two (which are very good) - I will see if I can
find the others today. I could update my reading list page so that it
includes the books I have in a pile waiting to be read. I'm not sure
if they will outnumber the ones I have read and put up there already -
it will certainly be fairly close. I really should start reading
more. My cue to exit. A return to my Guinness stained copy of Chapter
house Dune.

1999-09-02 13:20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rested - just under two hours, but it was undisturbed - I will sleep
no more today. An omelette and then to the shops. I have an urge to
buy a bowler hat, but I have had that urge for about 4 or 5 years - so
I probably won't buy one - they are far too expensive anyway...

1999-09-02 11:36
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drifting hither & thither. Sat on the ivory throne - finished but
unmoving. I regain clarity and return to my room to notice the door is
sticking - another distraction - the grease I bought for my skates
fixes things. Deep relief gel - I hope it helps my still aching left
leg - excellent stuff, but the smell of menthol is very strong - my
eyes are almost watering from the fumes. Need sleep. Then food. Then
shopping. More trousers - I have too many with holes in. More black
shirts - so coffee stains don't show.  A pair of shoes - if I can be
bothered. Comics too - 16 this week, busier than average but not
excessively so.

1999-09-02 10:45
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Laying in bed at home. The result of a bad KFC. Too tired to sleep - 3
hours sleep night before last - about 4-5 last night, broken up into
chunks between drowsy dashes to the bathroom. Reading Kerouac - drugs,
suicide, bop and Buddhism. Poetry unleashed by a master. Another
reader comes out of the closet - "I'm part time, so you won't know
me" - brings forth images of the full time staff with their heads in
the clouds, too important to notice the part timers scurrying round
our feet - is that how we are perceived? I hope not. Is that how I am
perceived? Probably. Too aloof for my own good. Don't want to mix
because the risk of pain is greater. Since when have I shied away from
pain? Self castigation. My own worst enemy.

Wed, 01 Sep 1999
----------------

1999-09-01 18:28
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I should stay away from bookshops - I'm too much of an impulse buyer -
two books I wanted - three that I picked up on impulse. One will
probably join Finnegan's Wake, The Thousand and One Nights and
Paradise Lost on the pile of books that I have always meant to read
but not yet got round to - 120 days of Sodom by deSade. The others I
will get round to when I start reading instead of writing again...

1999-09-01 17:48
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Made it through the day - but only just. I am glad I keep toothpaste
deodorant in the office - I stank when I arrived this morning. Home
again, home again, jiggety jig. I ordered some stuff online today - I
will have the rest of my surround speakers soon - 2 rears, a centre
and a sub. 120W sub should make plenty of noise in my tiny
room. Yum.

1999-09-01 07:02
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new month. Has anything changed? The diary has lightened up, but
circumstances have changed not at all. My mobile is now data enabled
and I have used up three quarters of my call allowance in one day. I
should probably uninstall ICQ to remove the temptation. Queued my
frequently used contacts for authorisation at three fifteen this
morning - Louise responded within about five seconds - does that girl
ever go offline? I thought I was the only one crazy enough to be on at
three am with a nine am start the next day. Obviously not.
Scary. Beginning of a quarter - phone bill time. Will be a big one
this quarter - damn you EverQuest for being so addictive. It must have
been at least four before I got to sleep and here I am at seven thirty
wide awake and updating my diary. How can I be up after three hours
sleep? It's not natural. It's a good job I'm not doing interviews
today - I look a bloody mess. I wonder when my billing date is for
Orange now. I may leave for work soon - not having left by now doesn't
feel right - I'm only in Blackheath though - it will only take about
half an hour to walk it. It took more last night - but that was
largely due to the fact that I am a fat bastard and took ages to get
over the park gates. Nice and easy at the Blackheath end though...
