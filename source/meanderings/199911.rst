Aaah! The smell of stale piss.&nbsp; Just what I need to finish off the
journey.&nbsp; Public transport would be so much better if they kept the general public
out.&nbsp; Hi-ho, Hi-ho, it's off to work I go...

   &nbsp; Should still be able to make it though.&nbsp; Just.&nbsp; New opening hours from

   8:00 if I do an early shift.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I may just give up late shifts and just do
   9-5:30 every day.&nbsp; I think there's going to be an 8:30-5 shift too - might start
   doing that one&nbsp; - gives me plenty of shopping time in the evening.&nbsp; Coffee

   mangas.&nbsp; I'm five episodes behind on Angel too - will have to catch up before I watch
   the crossover episodes...&nbsp; Definitely short on creativity - this is turning into a
   catalogue of what I watch and listen to.&nbsp; Not much fun people watching at this time
   of night - everyone looks the same - knackered and desperate to get home to bed. &nbsp;
   What was the name of that schools program with the animated squiggle that taught how to

   good enough bass response that I can turn off the bass boost on my CD player. But they are
   a bloody annoying shape - either the band is getting caught in my collar or they are
   pressing into the back of my ears. Annoying. But the quality of the music is good enough
   to lose myself and forget such material concerns.</p>

   it. Lost the plot. Time spent staring into space. Lost in space. Train stations opening
   everywhere. Luton airport parkway is open now. Not much use to me, just makes the

   <p align="left">Moon is definitely on the wane. Quite good night. Beer - mexican (food,
   cocktails, tequila) - more beer. Andy goes leaving a half - Aha! Think I. I pour it into
   my glass. I guess I'm on snakebite now. Bugger - I forgot Andy was on cider tonight.
   Misery wrapped in an enema. Or mystery wrapped in an enigma. Something or other. Nobody
   likes me, everybody hates me - I think I'll go and eat worms. It's been a while since the
   last major Friday night. About 3 weeks I think. Last week was just me and Matt Evans
   talking crap deep into the night - the week before I left early because I was depressed. I
   am oblivlon seeking again. Anything to take my mind off of a week on Friday. Billed to be
   the biggest fall I've taken in a long time. I am the antethesis of everyone on match.com
   that sounds interesting - have never recieved a single reply from an email I have sent. My
   website kills every mail initiated by a third party. Constant rejection. If I can't manage
   anything via email then I what chance have I in real life? Barmaid in the Auctioneer that
   I have never seen before. Like Alyson Hannigan with mousy hair instead of flame red.
   Gorgeous. Train is just outside the station. Why are there delays at this time of the
   evening? There is hardly anyone on any of these trains. Train after train pushes in front
   - mine was on the board about 3 trains ago - but hasn't come back since. 4 trains have
   jumped past it - all going to CX. Next one. Constantly jealous. What does he have that I
   haven't? A life. A personality. A face that doesn't look like an arse. I am shit. There is
   nothing I can offer that thousands of others can't. I am as unique as a five pence coin.
   Time to change the disc. Too fucked up to care any more. Fuck it all. Longing for nothing.
   I can tell people want me turn my stereo down, but I'm not going to. I'm ready to get on
   with the rest of my life. Where the fuck are you? Amusing Sony advert - get back at the
   people with annoying personal stereos by getting a better one. Main reason I can't be
   arsed with an mp3 player is that I have over 300 CDs to choose from with zero effort -
   with an mp3 player I would need to arse about in a big way when I wanted to change tracks.
   Wretched.</p>

   <p align="left">Crammed again. Am I really down at the moment or just putting on a show? I
   am actually not that down at heart, but I'm afraid to admit that - even to myself.
   Admitting that implies a reason - there is no concrete reason and I don't want to build
   any of the fantasy reasons any higher than they already are. Splish. Splash. Sphinx.
   Sweating. Will make the cold worse when I get out. What a convoluted dance I weave. Never

   <p align="left">Second night of the full moon - or is it the third? Cut up. Put up or shut
   up. Displays shafted again. Sideways seat. Order of preference - sideways, forwards,
   backwards. Sick. Sleep. Equipped. Stink. Not wrong. Somehow. Insulin. Penicillin. Tuft.
   Yellow. London skyline. Kinda beautiful. Some people never see tower bridge or big ben in
   person. I see those and more every day. Ungrateful wanker. I should be more appreciative
   of my surroundings. I won't be though. In my own way. Freak. Carried away. Scare. Score.
   Scar. Floor. Edging away. Building Lego walls around me. Mechano is very cool. As are
   stickle bricks. Retro. Wish I was at primary school again. Wasn't any easier - just less
   responsibilities. I still remember dropping my pencil while at junior school - when I bent
   down to pick it up my cheek pressed up against Anna Besch's arm - I still remember how
   soft and warm her skin was. 15+ years ago. Good memory. I am me. Nothing more to say on
   that subject though. My blocks are mine - if I wanted you to play with them I would tell
   you. Rules to live by. From an article I read the other day - full of truisms. Like - I
   will never remember important dates - I can barely remember my own birthday. If I ever
   forget an important date it's your fault for not reminding me. Ned's. Kill. Father's
   favourite chair. Sore eyes. Dizziness ensues. Crazy. Splendid. Marvellous. Wonderful.
   Stretched bladder. Need to make the treck to find relief. Aah. Crudity. Not of the salt
   and pepper variety. Vinegar. Food. Should have bought something at London Bridge. After
   beer munchies ensue. Nearly to my home town. Half hour from bed. Or an hour if I check my
   email first. Becoming. Ulcer on my lip. I wonder if we have any Bonjela. Disembarkation.

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">One of those going to work naked dreams last night. I think I may have
   noticed before I got there in this weather. Shopping time again. Only a few comics this
   time. The ones I didn't get Saturday. I was a total twat for not noticing. I said to put
   them on my standing order - meaning put them on the computer - but they were not in the
   bag when I got home, so I think he must have put them in my section of the standing order
   box ready to be collected at a later date. And I was too tired to notice. Or too
   unobservant. My hand hurts - I should stop writing really, but I have started so I'll keep
   going. Kapow. Kaching. Betrayal. Impossible for me - I never let anyone get close enough.
   I need someone with an emotional sledgehammer to break down the wall around my heart.
   Stronger from the inside than from the outside. Shoddy workmanship. Built to keep pain out
   - but in reality just stops pain getting out. Arse. I'm like a broken fucking record. One
   track mind. Need to re-focus. Exercise some internal censorship. People force their way
   onto the carriage. Hehe my hair has gained me some personal space - wind blows it into
   other people's faces, so they move back. I was just thinking about how I find nearly every
   woman on the underground this morning very attractive when suddenly I find myself in the
   middle of a crowd of ugly people. She looks remarkably like a frog - I wonder if she's
   some sort of lovecraftian amphibian hybrid.</p>

   <p align="left">I really wish I didn't care. Black. Black as the hounds of hell scratching
   menacingly at the door. Black as the void of space. Silent as the endless vacuum. I wish
   vacuum cleaners were silent. I hate their resonant whine. Smashing a vacuum cleaner with a
   sledgehammer would be fun. Or hitting one with a fast moving car. Or throwing one from a
   great height into a quarry. Therapeutic even thinking about it.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">11:19 pulls out 10 mins late - wonder how much slack time I have in the
   change at London Bridge. Should have gone in early rather than laying in bed watching the
   Fast Show. Wwwonderful. No-one even bothered to try and put the seat opposite me down.
   They all just assume it is broken. I wonder if anyone will have put it down before I get
   off. Probably not. Everyone is afraid of looking a twat. Burnt out already? I can feel a
   lot inside trying to get out. I am getting too self conscious - every time I start a new
   thread here I weigh up the consequences - wasn't what this was meant to be. Thought about
   giving it up yesterday - yet here I am again. Christ, I must love it. Kind of amuses me
   the way I can have a conversation with someone online and it will go fine - until they
   look at my web page and then all goes silent. There are exceptions - but they are few and
   far between. Cheese is nice. Have spent 90% of the weekend in bed watching videos. Not
   exactly productive, but fun and relaxing. Laughter is good. Forgot to shave this morning.
   My memory again. New David Lynch movie opens soon - cool. Not sure whether to find a plot
   synopsis on the web or not - I watched Lost Highway blind and really enjoyed it - didn't
   get a proper appreciation of it until the 3rd or 4th watching. Waiting for it to come out
   on video was very frustrating. Wonder how good the Film Four studio is at releasing to DVD
   quickly... Might check see if anywhere has the R1 disc on pre-order yet... Splendid. I
   can't abide silence. Hair getting in my eyes - I quite like it actually. Has never really
   bothered me. Difficult to focus close enough to look for split ends. Time for a disc
   change. Slow burn. Cold flame. Light blistering. I have no idea what I am talking about.
   Approaching London Bridge - will have enough time for a coffee. Great.</p>

   <p align="left">We've stopped again. I'm probably not even going to make the 8:52 at this
   rate - even if it is as late as it usually is. Scorn. Strong. Carrot. Lariot. Shackles.
   Packed like cattle. Matter. Warming up. I quite like cold - but only in moderation.
   Vacant. Dirty. Sick. Yawn. Ooh! Movement... Wonder how far we'll get. Suits. Upholstery.
   Carpet. Feel like laying face down on carpet. Bizarre urge - one I will resist. Over.
   Head. All for the best in the long run. Do I have a long run? I never run far. I never run
   at all if I can help it. Trains seem to do their best to avoid running too. Not good.
   Stuck in a tunnel. If I'd got off and braved the Northern line at Kings Cross I'd be at
   London Bridge by now. Warmth generated. Cozy. Want to drift off to sleep, but need to keep
   myself awake. Uncomfortable seat. Out into the light. Picture of insanity. The clear blue
   sky in winter. Farringdon at last - only 20 minutes after I left Kings Cross - could have
   walked it in that time. Do you think I really care? Can I? I don't think so. Entry
   peppered with song lyrics - even more than usual. It's a long time since I've missed the
   8:52 - I don't even know when the next one is. Wonder if there's time for a coffee. Bloke
   next to me has got up - there is room for my fat arse on the seat now. In sight of the
   millenium wheel. What a bag of shite. Four star. Shame. Stopped again - what the fuck is
   it this time? We're well past the broken train... God I hate being surrounded by beautiful
   people. Well deserved. A walk in the rain would be good right now. Scrape. All in black.
   Gorgeous. Painfully so. Sun in my eyes - blinded by the light. More delays - we've missed
   our slot - don't fit in - I am used to that at least... Not enough sleep last night (as

   mediocrity. Nothing. Little man in a cheese canoe. Kayak. Eyes wide open but not seeing
   anything. Train ahead is recieving fitter's attention - what are they fitting? Just
   another day - as pointless as the rest. I like fish. Bish bosh. Luvverly. Wonder whether I
   will miss my connection. Probably. Great. Half hour of freezing my fingers off waiting for
   the next one. Train at Farringdon is blocking both directions. Ouch. Why do americans call
   a tip a gratuity? Why the need to invent a word when one already exists? I believe the
   word derives from gratitude - but when I hear it I think of a minor act of violence
   (excessive violence is gratuitous - so a minor act of violence is a gratuity). On the move

   got my coffee before the woman in front of me (who had ordered a large latte - not quick

   <span class="title">19:05 - Earristim bugle ism suality paper.</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Have calmed now - especially after reading the amazing
   5th volume of Janny Wurts' Wars of Light and Shadow series - Grand
   Conspiracy.&nbsp; I have read a lot of books since the last instalment
   and had forgotten just how convoluted the machinations in her books
   get - plots within plots within plots.&nbsp; A total headfuck.&nbsp; I
   wouldn't have it any other way.&nbsp; Haven't been able to concentrate
   on it as clearly as I would like, and have found myself taking
   frequent breaks.&nbsp; Distracted by music mainly - actually found
   myself sobbing while listening to Midnight Queen by Inkubus Sukkubus
   last night.&nbsp; No tears, just a couple of sobs accompanied by a
   deep clinging sadness.  &nbsp; I really need something to cheer me up,
   but just sit here alone with no ideas.  &nbsp; Find myself
   overreacting to minor things.&nbsp; Like this morning...&nbsp; I
   should get out and do anything, but have no drive.&nbsp; No point to
   it.&nbsp; Nothing ever changes. Why would it?&nbsp; The world is
   comfortable with the place I hold at present and has no desire to see
   me move beyond it.&nbsp; Now listening to American music which is
   trying desperately to be late 80s British Indy - right down to fake
   British accents.  &nbsp; Wannabes.&nbsp; Thought some cheery music
   might cheer me up - should have known better - that never works with
   me - happy things only work when I am already up - when I am down they
   just channel my depression into anger.&nbsp; I am fire - where is my
   water?  &nbsp; I am earth - where is my air?&nbsp; All four elements
   are needed in equality to free the spirit.&nbsp; Without my
   counterpart I languish in mediocrity.</p>
   
   <p align="left">In a darkness without end<br> Seeking the light<br>
   The horizon burns<br> As I fly towards it as fast as the wind<br> But
   it is never gets closer<br> No end to the chase in sight<br> The wild
   hunt will go stretch through eternity</p>
   
   <p align="left">Do I prefer verse or prose?&nbsp; Prose is easier
   certainly, but verse has a power.&nbsp; A resonance that is lacking in
   other forms.</p>
   
   <p align="left">Cheery lyrics grate<br> Rub the wrong side of my
   tainted self<br> Not hard enough to remove the stain<br> Just hard
   enough to cause friction.<br> The heat refuses to dissipate<br>
   Gathers in my chest<br> Threatens to burst out<br> I try to swallow
   it<br> It is acquiescent for the present<br> But the truce will not
   hold forever<br> I need somewhere to ground the static<br> Before
   lightening strikes<br> And burns an irreparable hole through my
   soul</p>
   
   <p align="left">The vortex swirls in my stomach<br> A dark
   whirlpool<br> Threatening to swallow my existence<br> I stubbornly
   refuse<br> Why?</p>
   
   <p align="left">Swirling.&nbsp; I cannot capture the emotions.&nbsp;
   No words to express what is happening in my head at the moment.&nbsp;
   Wound tight inside.&nbsp; I need to get it out before something snaps,
   but nothing will come. Black. Always.&nbsp; A vortex, but there is no
   tide.&nbsp; There is no effort expended to keep myself from being
   sucked it.  &nbsp; Or maybe that is a deception - maybe the tug is so
   light that I don't notice as small parts of my self are torn off and
   absorbed.&nbsp; Need to do something.&nbsp; Will probably just sleep -
   easy way out - avoid the problems.&nbsp; Embrace of oblivion. &nbsp;
   Dark maiden welcoming me home. Wrapped in the cool comfort of her
   raven wings. &nbsp; It is too early for sleep though - no matter how
   tired I am of the waking world. &nbsp; Sleep now would just bring
   wakefulness too early tomorrow.&nbsp; Room is a mess. &nbsp; Maybe I
   could tidy it up.&nbsp; Or maybe monkeys will fly out of my
   arse. &nbsp; Have spent all day reading a challenging book - am not
   really ready for the burdens of concentration.&nbsp; Maybe I could
   just watch some unassuming videos.&nbsp; Was thinking the other day
   that it was I while since I watched my Aeon Flux videos - could be a
   good time to rectify that.&nbsp; Feel lighter for having made the
   decision.&nbsp; Not sure that I want to stop, as I seem to have
   unlocked something - the words are streaming now.&nbsp; Maybe I should
   just wait for the end of the album.&nbsp; A pain in the neck. &nbsp;
   From lying down all day no doubt.&nbsp; I wish I wasn't so fidgety - I
   find it difficult to lay still while reading or sleeping - continually
   shifting position. &nbsp; Not easy to find a position except laying on
   my back that is suited to reading - usually end up with stiff elbows
   and neck - rest by putting the book on the floor and dangle my head
   off of the end of the bed.&nbsp; Need a drink.&nbsp; Back in a
   sec. &nbsp; Not really in the mood for music at the moment - but I
   play some anyway to ward off the emptiness.&nbsp; Sometimes emptiness
   is to be savoured.&nbsp; Other times it consumes. &nbsp; Brief
   distraction to help a damsel in distress.&nbsp; A bit dramatic - it
   was actually a request from mum to find info about Theseus on the
   Internet for one of her friend's daughter so she can do her
   homework.&nbsp; Helped distract me for a while though. &nbsp; Enough
   time.&nbsp; I am finished here.&nbsp; Goodbye.</p>

   am.&nbsp; I can feel myself building to a very public fall - and I now have another 3
   weeks to build up the pedestal from which I will drop.&nbsp; Not high enough to kill on
   impact - just high enough to hurt.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; I wish I didn't get so obsessional.
   &nbsp; Tonight shouldn't be a big deal - shit happens.&nbsp; But it was.&nbsp; And now
   it's not.&nbsp; I don't know what I feel - but I know I won't be spending the next few
   days with a smile on my face.&nbsp; The train is late too.&nbsp; I hate my life.&nbsp; I
   have no reason to be like this.&nbsp; No-one owes me anything.&nbsp; I have no right to be
   such an impatient fuck.&nbsp; As I wrote earlier - 3 weeks is less than 0.25% of my life
   so far.&nbsp; It's nothing in the general scheme of things.&nbsp; The past week has seemed
   like an eternity though.&nbsp; I hope she doesn't cancel on the 3rd too.&nbsp; I'm not
   actually too keen on hearing the words &quot;Actually - I liked you better when I didn't
   know you.&nbsp; Can you go away now please...&quot;&nbsp; but I would prefer to have heard
   them tonight than to expect them for the next 3 weeks.&nbsp; There is always the

   not my cup of tea. The album is shaping up pretty well though. Not a one song wonder as

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">A quick follow up to my last comment for those of you that don't work for
   ISPs - I'm not against un-metered internet calls. I'm very much for it if the phone
   network can cope. The problem is that the average user doesn't know when it's the phone
   company's problem and when it's the ISP. When windows says &quot;line busy&quot; they will
   assume that the ISP doesn't have enough lines. Untrue (most of the time). We have never
   had all of our modems/lines in use and yet we constantly get engaged tones reported. Why?
   Most of the time it's because a BT switch on the call path is too busy - we never even see
   the thing. The only thing we can do is bitch at BT (and they are probably going to listen
   to an end user before they listen to us - we aren't even a customer...). BT then pass then
   info to planning. Um, hello? Aren't planning supposed to be looking for this before it
   happens? &quot;Wanted: one network planning specialist 20/20 hindsight essential.&quot;
   Planning and engineering both know the network is underprovisioned - so what is the next
   move from marketing? To introduce a pricing structure that will dramatically increase the
   traffic at precisely the points which are having problems coping. Nice one. Left
   hand/right hand. Foot/mouth. Piss-up/brewery. Oh - before I go: These comments are my
   personal opinion and in no way express the official stance of my employers - blah, blah.</p>

   backed up by actions. Topic change. BT already has an overcrowded network with exchanges
   way over capacity - and yet they are talking about offering an un-metered internet access
   tariff as a product to ISPs - way to go you bunch of cunts - we already get blamed for
   your switch overcrowding - now we get to look evil because we have to charge higher

   existence, where God just doesn't feel like it (nyah!) Maybe God is just a mis-represented
   astronaut. How on earth do I get started on these things? Seat with a table - wow. I'd
   trade it all for shoulder room. Actually I've already proved that I wouldn't - I could
   have had shoulder room by standing - but I chose to sit instead. There shouldn't have to
   be that choice - the choice that causes people to not use public transport - the choice
   that is destroying the world. Help the individual at the expense of the community.

   not at all. No half measures. I am a night person - will you share that or will you teach
   me to delight in the day? We will talk by moonlight. By candle light. By the light of the
   television screen as we watch cheesy B-movies. We will share the moment of glory as the
   sunrise ignites the horizon. We will laugh and it will make the whole world shine like a
   jewel. When we argue we will be like demons - but the reconciliation will be divine. I
   believe you are there. Am I a hopeless romantic? Yes. Does it cause me pain? Certainly. Do

   Annihilation.&nbsp; Anyone for a cuppa?&nbsp; Who's mum?&nbsp; Dragged down into
   hell.&nbsp; Fires of torment.&nbsp; At least it's not cold.&nbsp; An empty shell sits here
   writing - pouring out what little is inside - what does it leave me?&nbsp; The emptiness I
   feel is in my heart and gut - some of this comes from those places - rather than purely
   from my head.&nbsp; Grey outside.&nbsp; Overcast.&nbsp; Not raining.&nbsp; The trees have
   nearly lost their leaves - still some stubborn remnants remain.&nbsp; Won't give up.
   &nbsp; Sooner or later they will fall.&nbsp; Everything does. A solitary bird sits on a
   dead tree.&nbsp; The only trace of life visible from my window. Sitting here looking
   sideways while typing - I will get a sore neck doing this, but without doing so I cannot
   admire the beauty of nature while I do this.&nbsp; The full cycle visible.&nbsp; The left
   and right hand path. All is natural.&nbsp; Time to start taking the right hand path - the
   left has brought me nothing but pain.&nbsp; Law of Three.&nbsp; Anarchism at it's finest.
   &nbsp; Moon made of Ice.&nbsp; Of Cheese.&nbsp; Polystyrene.&nbsp; No shapes to see in the
   clouds - a uniform grey with sporadic spots of darkness spread across it like the
   mud-stained fingerprints of a small child.&nbsp; Words are a prison for meaning.&nbsp; Am
   I inmate or jailer?</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Miserable.&nbsp; No change there.&nbsp; Soul empty.&nbsp; Fill me. &nbsp;
   Darkness has fallen outside.&nbsp; Clean.&nbsp; But not cleansed.&nbsp; Why? &nbsp; Where
   is the off button - I've had enough.&nbsp; Standby.&nbsp; If only we could put ourselves
   in suspended animation during the boring times.&nbsp; Fast forward. &nbsp; Deja-vu - I was
   talking about that with someone a few days ago...&nbsp; Shadows dancing.&nbsp; Look into
   the flames.&nbsp; Sputter.&nbsp; Light turned out.&nbsp; There is no darkness in the
   modern age - the candle burns, but is assisted by the glow of my screen - my alarm clock -
   the charge light flashing on my razor - the front display of my CD player - my amp - my
   VCR - house lights from the neighbours come in through the windows - the light of the town
   reflecting from the clouds above.&nbsp; The only true darkness is within.&nbsp;
   Firebug.&nbsp; Sticking matchsticks into the molten wax of the candle - watching the
   flames dance higher.&nbsp; The wick is now too low to burn - smothered - I will have to
   hope that enough wax burns off from the matches otherwise it will be useless. &nbsp; I
   haven't had any decent sized candles for ages.&nbsp; I can stare into a flame for
   hours.&nbsp; A form of meditation.&nbsp; I should have gone to a bonfire.&nbsp; It's never
   the same in a crowd though - staring into a fire is a time for contemplation - something
   to be done on your own, or with someone so close that they feel a part of yourself. &nbsp;
   I wish.&nbsp; The embers of the dead matches glow.&nbsp; The flame dances in the wind of
   my breath.&nbsp; All is calm.&nbsp; Harmonious.&nbsp; The candle is about to die. &nbsp;
   The wick is still below the level of the pool of wax, and one of the matches has just
   collapsed - the other cannot be far behind.&nbsp; A new match sorts that one.&nbsp; I
   can't believe I am actually writing this - I must be incredibly bored.&nbsp; I have never
   been able to get the hang of totally automatic writing - I am always thinking about it.
   &nbsp; I have never been able to do glossolalia either - I have tried, but my mind never
   seems to let go.&nbsp; Always on duty.&nbsp; The wick has caught at last - the candle is
   saved.&nbsp; Not that any of this matters - what is a single candle in the eyes of the
   Goddess?&nbsp; Brunching.com haven't updated Tina the Troubled Teen's saying for several
   days now.&nbsp; Why is it they always forget to update when a crap one is selected. &nbsp;
   Falling without moving.&nbsp; Eternal freefall.&nbsp; Am I falling towards something or
   away from something?&nbsp; Chaos mind.&nbsp; Nothing lasts forever. &nbsp; Simple
   thermodynamics.&nbsp; Entropy theory.&nbsp; Fireworks again - a flash in the sky.&nbsp;
   Momentary light - but not enough to pierce the shadow shroud.&nbsp; Wrapped in the deep
   darkness.&nbsp; Oh for the embrace of oblivion - all comes to those who wait. Flecks of
   burnt wood from the matches are floating in the wax pool pulled towards the wick like a
   dark microscopic reflection of a moth - the closer you look the more detail there
   is.&nbsp; A fractal world.&nbsp; Entranced.&nbsp; Time passes.&nbsp; Life passes by.
   &nbsp; Is it being wasted?&nbsp; I feel content at the moment, so I would say not. &nbsp;
   Perhaps I could feel better than content - but I could certainly feel worse, so I am not
   motivated to experiment.&nbsp; Drinking water.&nbsp; Hair in my eyes.&nbsp; Have gone back
   to keeping it slightly longer.&nbsp; I realised what a twat I looked when it was too
   short.&nbsp; I probably still look a twat - but at least not in my own eyes, which is a
   positive.&nbsp; Ooh - pretty.&nbsp; More fireworks.&nbsp; Some of them quite impressive.
   &nbsp; Haven't updated the readinglist page for ages - have read about 4 books that don't
   even appear.&nbsp; Was a pointless page anyway.&nbsp; All of this is pointless.&nbsp; None
   of it truly matters in my heart - perhaps this page - it helps sometimes - I am no longer
   quite as twisted up inside. Another shave.&nbsp; Random clicking about within the page -
   no modifications made - just random browsing.&nbsp; Killing time.&nbsp; Maybe I should
   sleep again.&nbsp; I would only wake up later unable to sleep anymore - and would then
   have to kill time then.&nbsp; Music has finished - something to do - choose what to listen
   to next.&nbsp; Have extinguished the candle.&nbsp; Will burn it again some other time.
   &nbsp; Will turn on the lights.&nbsp; Go downstairs perhaps.&nbsp; Read some, maybe eat.
   &nbsp; Try to be normal for a while.</p>

   Sunday is a day of loneliness.&nbsp; Saturday is not quite as bad - at least I could go
   shopping and lose myself in a crowd - on Sunday there are not as many shops open. &nbsp; I
   don't really have anything I want to buy anyway - would end up buying films that I will

   - I end up just sitting in the corner brooding.&nbsp; My thing.&nbsp; It's what I do.
   &nbsp; I'm the outsider.&nbsp; The loner.&nbsp; Take my scars. Take my life. Goodbye.
   &nbsp; Still wondering how I cut my arm.&nbsp; It itches.&nbsp; I need to do something to
   pass the time other than this - something that will just erase a period of my life - sweet
   oblivion calls me into her arms.&nbsp; Time to play a game.&nbsp; Not feeling sociable, so
   not EverQuest.&nbsp; SS2 or GTA2 - I think SS2 first - not until the music stops though -
   won't be able to hear the FX in the game with music this loud - and I can't turn this CD
   down - it wouldn't be right.&nbsp; &quot;Do you think I'll still be lonely, God I pray
   that I'm less lonely When I'm dead.&quot;&nbsp; I hope Mum's Celine Dion CD has finished.

   motherfucker burn. Cellular mesh of lies. Of hate. The fires of my hatred burn so bright -
   how can I extinguish them? What is being consumed to feed them? Listen to them - children

   Pregnant pause. Last track - Samhain. Time to change the disc. Synchronicity. I quote

   &nbsp; Just watched Something about Mary - bloody funny film.&nbsp; Thanks for
   recommending it last week Dan :)&nbsp; Now listening to Midnight Configuration's Funeral
   Nation.&nbsp; Sounds superb with my subwoofer.&nbsp; Life is good.&nbsp; Apart from the
   fact it's not. Almost had a happy thought there - managed to catch myself in time
   though...&nbsp; Just had a look at some horoscope stuff on match.com.&nbsp; It's all a
   load of bollocks.&nbsp; It's amazing how they manage to write it so that it could apply to
   anyone.&nbsp; So bored that I'm shaving again - putting my razor next to my computer was a
   good way of making sure I keep clean shaven. Electric razor never shaves as clean as a wet
   shave though.&nbsp; I seem to have managed to cut myself on my arm.&nbsp; I don't know how
   it happened - I can only assume I managed to do it while I was picking grit out of the
   sole of my foot with a Stanley knife earlier.&nbsp; Don't know how I managed to do it
   without noticing though.Wasn't deliberate - even in my subconscious I would have cut
   deeper than that.&nbsp; My amazon order didn't arrive today - It'll probably arrive
   tomorrow when there's no-one in and I'll have to go down the post office on Saturday.
   &nbsp; Bugger.&nbsp; Ordered a couple of CDs from the music section a couple of days
   before they sent out the announcement of the section opening.&nbsp; Not big or clever, but
   possibly vaguely interesting.&nbsp; No it isn't, it's just another string in my bow of
   sadness.&nbsp; What does another string in you bow mean anyway?&nbsp; I don't care to be
   quite honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't care about anything.&nbsp; Say it enough and it might

   everything - looking through a subdued red haze. From deep down in my twisted psyche. I
   fear me.</p>

   <p align="left">Am I real? I must be - only reality could be so fucked up. Grasp the
   nettle. Ignore the pain. Craven. A dark world full of pain. Pinpricks of beauty to focus
   the hurt onto the depths of our souls. A ray of light piercing the shadow shroud
   surrounding my heart. Semi permeable membrane - fresh hurt can get in, but what is there
   already is trapped and must remain there to fester. Butterfly. Beauty is fragile - so
   easily destroyed - so easily corrupted. A shell around the decomposing heart. An
   irresistible trap for the unwary. On the outside looking in. Unfounded accusations.
   Paranoia. All that I am. I hope one day to be more than this shell filled with hate. Moss
   on the walls. Cool and damp. Like the grave. Remembrance that this isn't forever helps.
   &quot;And his name is Atrocity&quot;. Killing is OK when done in the name of peace. Or the
   name of God. Silence comes. I cannot stand it for long so a quick break from writing is
   required. Better. With music I feel the emptiness less acutely. The music talks to my
   soul. Time to abandon self and bask in the divinity of it.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Living my life in a haze of daydreams. Maybe it is the hunger. I wish I
   didn't forget to eat. I haven't actually eaten anything today. My only sustenance has been
   coffee and soft drinks. As ever I am obsessing - inventing an endless stream of scenarios
   that will never play out. Even if the circumstances arose I would never do the right
   thing. I can think of a number of occasions in the past which prove just how bad I am at
   handling non-technical conversations. I have conditioned myself to say the minimum
   possible - saves me from having to explain myself, which is inevitable. Also minimises the
   number of times I make myself look a twat by saying exactly the wrong thing. Again
   something I have done many times in the past. I am crap at everything that means anything.
   I don't like me - so why the hell would anyone else? Everything wrong. Why me? Time to
   change the disc. I wish I could change the track inside. Wish I didn't obsess so much.
   Wish I didn't resort to wishing and actually get off of my arse and do something.
   Apathetic. Pathetic. Want it all. And want delivery. Lazy. Whenever I have made an effort
   in the past I have done the wrong thing and fucked things up. Sim and the card. Nagel's
   bike. Erin and the email. Fights because I wouldn't back down. The worst - there are
   others. Nothing ever works - so why bother? Obsessing again. Focusing on past failures.
   Can't focus on future success because I can't see into the future. Even if I could I would
   need a microscope to make any chances of success visible. Defeatist attitude - it's the
   only one I have.</p>

   <p align="left">Another day down. Everything wrong. Bought a Xentrix album - hoping it
   would measure up to &quot;For whose advantage?&quot; it didn't. Bought a couple of
   &quot;My Dying Bride&quot; CDs - the new one was quite good - like Gothic/Shades of God
   period Paradise Lost. The older one wasn't much cop though. The Rob Zombie remixes and the
   Inkubus Sukkubus discs were all damn good though - so not a total waste of money in Tower
   this morning. Listening to a bizarre Christmas track at the moment. I'll have to listen to
   the cover of Delilah on the other disc later - delightfully bizarre. Everything wrong.
   What do I do right? Am off Wednesday and Thursday - might go and get my eyebrow pierced.
   Time to submerge myself in music for a while - can't seem to loosen up and say what I feel
   at the moment.</p>

   <p align="left">I've just realised that this thing hasn't realised that the clocks went
   back. Bugger. Trains are right up the spout today. Omg - I've just recognised this track -
   a goth cover of &quot;Paint it black&quot; - cool, my favourite Stones track. Waiting for
   the train to pull out. Going to be late. After rushing from Piccadilly to Charing X -
   pointless. Should have just taken it easy. Moving at last. This train is only half an hour
   late. And it's not even the right one - it's only a connection to London Bridge because
   the Greenwich train isn't starting at CX today... Why do I get so inane when I'm not
   depressed? Actually it's probably less inane than my endless winging about how crap my
   life is. At least late trains are a concrete fact - not a construct of my infinite self
   doubt. Almost to London Bridge. Wonder how long I will have to wait. Raining. As the
   Suicidal Tendencies song goes &quot;you can't bring me down&quot;. Not quite managed a
   U-turn - don't know what direction I am facing now.</p>

   <p align="left">Amusing university anecdote. In the first year, when I was in halls one of
   the people on my corridor did a tally of how often I used the word &quot;Fuck&quot;. Why
   is it I resort to vulgarity so often. This song is so over the top - it's obscene yet
   funny at the same time. &quot;Come and taste the bitter fruit, I will drain you of your

   <p align="left">Is my repeated listening to the darkest corners of my music collection an
   attempt to regain the shadow on my soul? I am listening to the wrong CD if that is so -
   this has very dark lyrics, but it makes me feel up. I have always been a pagan at heart -
   even if I have never been a practising pagan. Wrong gender for Wicca. It's a
   bastardisation anyway. The original ways are lost. Crushed beneath the heels of
   Christianity. Blessed be. I am going to see if Tower have any of IS's other albums -
   although I'm not sure if I have time. This closing half an hour earlier puts a dent in my
   shopping. Is this lyric &quot;song for our age&quot; or &quot;song for our rage&quot; 1st
   fits the album tone better - but 2nd fits my needs better.</p>
