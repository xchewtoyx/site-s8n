Random Meanderings of a Twisted Soul

Here I am, sitting alone on a Sunday morning. I have decided to create
this page as a sort of stream of consciousness journal. I won't be
filling it in every day (although some days I'll add a half dozen
entries), it won't be a catalogue of what I do (except when it is). If
you want to read other diaries/journals then try :ref:`these
links<diaries>` at the bottom of this page. For a general background
on me try :doc:`../mynameis`. If you're brave you may want to `email
the author`_

.. _email the author: mailto:chewtoy@s8n.net

The most recent entry will be at the top, so if you're new here then
start at the :ref:`archives` (if you're not new here - what on Earth
possessed you to come back?!?)...

When you're done, go back to the :doc:`main page</index>`...

I've had to split things up - the page was bigger than most of the
images on the site, the current week will be on this page, but past
weeks will be archived elsewhere, use the list of links at the
:ref:`bottom<archives>` of the page to get to the old stuff:

17:28 - Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Got my 46" pintail sliding this afternoon. Was trying last Thursday, but the
Khiro Yellow barrels I had on there had far too much rebound; couldn't get my
hand down reliably, kept bouncing back to a straight line...

I need to order a job lot of Khiro red and blue barrels and blue bottom
inserts.

Sliding the pin was definitely a different feeling from the Globe 38". Dropping
the rear knee was much more important to get the tail to whip around. Not sure
how much was to do with the crappy Krypto Hawaii wheels (finally scrubbed off
the seam line today). They ride harder than the 78A they're supposed to be, but
they seem to have more grip than my other 78s. The flat deck on the pin was a
definite disadvantage too.

Oh, and since I started working on upper body strength I've managed to gain
about 5 kg. So much for trying to drop below the 100kg mark...
