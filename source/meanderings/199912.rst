Got up too early today. I could quite possibly be working until 8 tomorrow
morning, but I was up at 8 today. Oh well, at least I have plenty of pro-plus
at the office.

   <p align="left">Infrequent updates. Train not busy, but very bouncy. Chatting constantly
   for a couple of days and I always drag the subject back to me. I have been told I'm cute -
   that I cannot believe. I've been called a freak. That I can. Fun fun fun. 2000 is already
   beginning elsewhere. For most of the people I have been chatting with it will be in about
   15 mins. I'll have to get on the news sites as soon as I get into the office... And ICQ of
   course - can't live without it now. The wheel won't turn tonight - a good omen perhaps?</p>

   <span class="title">21:11 - Demorill pitaunde reunivervient.</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Back from my sister's and back in the saddle. I'm getting back into
   the depressed state of mind. Christmas will tend to do that. Lot's of
   happyjoykissfucklove on TV, staying with my younger sister and her two beautiful kids and
   seeing her with her boyfriend. And not being called at all. Not that I blame
   her - she would have to be insane to want to call me. I have to give up. To
   sit back and let life go on. Something will happen sooner or later. Something.
    Such as death. More likely than love... Nothing will change. Do I
   never learn? No I don't. Stubborn as a mule. I allow myself to be sucked
   into the hope that something is finally going right in my personal life when I know I am
   not ready. I am not a good catch - I am a shit. I am lazy, messy, impolite,
   unobservant, forgetful. I would be loving and loyal - but those are traits best
   found in a dog, sure they should be at the core of a relationship, but other things are
   needed as well. There is also the shell that I have built around myself.
    No-one and nothing gets in or out. I am not fully convinced of my lack
   of worth and that is where my problem lies. If I were fully convinced then I could
   either give up all hope of a relationship and get on with the other parts of my life, or I
   could kill myself now and do the world a favour. Or do the other parties in any
   possible future relationships a favour anyway... But I persist in the notion that perhaps
   there is something that someone could see in me. Sure there's the money, but I would
   never want a relationship based on that. I'd be better off just visiting a whore.
    My self esteem is low enough, without giving myself proof that the only way I
   can get laid is to pay for it. It's probably the truth though. There are very
   few subjects I can actually talk about, especially with strangers. Computers and my
   lack of a relationship are the two that seem to come up most often. I get very
   disillusioned with computers though and like to keep the conversation away from them
   unless things get desperate. Computers are so close to the core of all that's fucked
   up in my life. Maybe if I'd never found out about computers my life would have gone
   differently and I would have been forced to interact with others more often, causing me to
   have more self confidence. Not likely though - I probably would have just found the
   joys of double entry book keeping and become an accounts clerk or something. I
   should stop blaming the job. Plenty of computer geeks find love. It's nothing
   to do with that and everything to do with the fact that I am a social misfit. No
   that's wrong too. Plenty of people don't fit in with society. I just don't fit
   with people fullstop. The only social activity I take part in is getting pissed,
   which is hardly a good way to meet people. I'm usually too pissed to remember my own
   name without having to really concentrate. No-one seems to believe that I am worse
   at chatting in real life than I am online. I am though. My online chat skills
   are pretty dire - I can hold my own in the insane babblings of the KK, but when things
   turn serious it's back to either computers, alcohol or my lack of a love life. And
   it's me that starts it every fucking time. I think I enjoy telling people how shit I
   am. Even more proof that I'm a total fuck up - as if any was needed. Yup, I'm
   definitely on a downturn again...</p>

   Fucking hilarious. Gareth has quite possibly the loudest snore ever. It was quite funny

   Furby alarm clock. At least I think it was an alarm clock 'cause I heard it going off at

   <span class="title">19:41 - Anlitati twinfan behoolon.</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Fast train on the slow tracks. Wobbly. Now that people know we
   are going the right way they have all shut up. Things back to the usual insularity.
    Fear brings people out of their shells. I wish I could share my fear with
   someone - but all my fears are internal. Blackfriars. Usual journey time: 5
   mins. Tonight's time: 50 mins. Hope there aren't problems finding a slot on
   the rails on the way back. Getting withdrawal symptoms. Been having too much
   fun online recently - not good for my material - I'm supposed to be lonely and brooding.
   Actually I still am, but now I have company - and misery loves that... Listening to
   a heavyweight song on a lightweight album. Splendid. Light rock, but with one
   song that pulls no punches. Come clean. Fucking really fucking matters. True.
    Well the thought of fucking anyways - I survive well enough without the physical
   reality of it. Or do I? This site was called &quot;truly diseased&quot;
   earlier today... I guess it's just not my lucky millennium. Maybe the next one
   will be better. I don't really feel able to open up tonight - usually I would just
   rant on in that vein for ages - but I know there are a few new arrivals here who aren't
   used to my ways. It would be nice to break them in slowly, but this site isn't
   supposed to be about the reader. I'm leaving the point. If there is one.
    I guess missing the point is the point really - if anything the point is
   psychological. The need to rant. Heh, I had a random ICQ from an American
   psych student a week or so ago. She said she was going to read my diary, and then I
   never heard back. That should frighten me, but instead it amuses. I do have
   some cool regulars though. Can be a bit bizarre talking to people who have seen that
   deep into my psyche... The women who have fed back on the site are pretty cool - but
   the ones to feed back make up less than 10% of those I have sent here - most of them have
   never said a word to me again... The funniest feedback comes from the blokes though.
    I've had &quot;Have you tried Prozac?&quot;, &quot;You should get yourself a whore.
    They're just girls doing a job, there's nothing dirty about it&quot; and now I've
   had &quot;Your site is truly diseased&quot;. All comments were made with the best
   intentions though and I love them all.</p>

    We are going the way that the driver announced, but everyone is panicking. 
   Hehe, delicious. Lucky I've got nowhere to go. The driver has just switched
   ends of the train. Hassled as he walks through the carriage. He has just given
   us the same announcement as earlier, but they can't have been listening as they have all
   breathed a sigh of relief. Hopefully we shouldn't be too much longer before getting
   back on course. I probably should have gone out on my own for a drink tonight -
   they'll probably have the signals fixed at London Bridge long before we get back to
   Blackfriars. Still - it's saving my phone bill I suppose - if I wasn't stuck on a
   train I'd be back at home on ICQ by now...</p>

   when Cooper returns to Sunnydale post Bob. The nigh invulnerable Tick hears tell of the
   demons in Sunnydale and figures he should lend a hand. Myndi could come too. Add them to
   the stack of ideas that I will probably never do. The other crossovers: Miyu, the Marx

   <p align="left">Clawing my way out from my pit of despair. Lots of encouragement from
   others - that hasn't really helped though - my apathy has just taken over and killed the
   rage. Knowing people care enough to offer meaningless platitudes like &quot;that sort of
   thing happens to everyone&quot; and &quot;one day you'll meet someone you're not nervous
   around&quot; is nice. I don't have to believe what they say to appreciate the sentiment. I
   have got to give up on things for now. I am not ready. Maybe with a few more years of life
   experience under my belt. God, I wish that thought didn't fill me with dread - I've been
   alone for more than two decades - what is a few years more? Well it's a few years less to
   spend with the right person for a start... This unified messaging is going to play havoc
   with my phone bill - time to check my messages... </p>

   <p align="left">There's not enough inside to fuel a white hot rage. Has subsided to a dull
   seething - the embers not even glowing enough to warm me. Cold. Engulfing despair is
   closing in. Soon no light will remain and my heart will once more be engulfed in darkness.
   Better than I deserve. Self absorbed wanker. Wallowing in self pity. Pity the sadness. The
   picture I took this week shows a hint of a smile. Just goes to show I'm only happy when
   I'm sad. I must enjoy fucking my life up. Twisted. At least my conscious and sub-conscious
   mind are in agreement - they both hate me. Trains are fucked up, I have no coffee. This
   sucks.</p>

   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">It's good to talk - kinda essential when you're relating with anyone who
   isn't you. Incomplete. Incompetent. Verbally constipated. In desperate need of a laxative.
   Words flow like glass - takes several millennia for each word to drip out. I think just
   about the worst thing I can imagine happening to me is some freak accident granting me
   immortality. At least when I think eternal loneliness I know it is only another 60 years
   tops - God that seems a long time. I'd wish that I had someone to share it with if it
   wasn't pointless. Even if I met her I'd be too shit scared to talk to her. At best I would
   bore her - at worst insult or upset her by giving the impression I was ignoring her. I am
   such a monumental fuck-up.</p>

   <p align="left">I just want to get so drunk that I lapse into a coma and never wake up. Or
   to be the only victim of a freak earthquake - swallowed whole by the earth. Pathetic loser
   fuckwit arsehole tit bastard. There are no words that cut deep enough. I keep hoping that
   if I hate myself enough maybe something will snap and I will change. It's not happening
   though. Still just as bad as I've ever been. One of the numerous freaks inflicted on the
   world by a fucked-up society. Is it genetic? Was it my upbringing? My sister had the same
   upbringing, but she turned out ok. A fault in the centres of social function in my brain.
   No good for anything but my work - which I enjoy - but is not enough to fill the void I
   feel in my chest. I just wish I could be myself when I am with others - but apparently
   that is too much to ask - my mind won't allow it. I have to restrict it to these hours of
   lonely boredom on the train. Pathetic.</p>

   <span class="title">20:00 - Dents dischiest christicali abadger.</span>
   <span class="body">
   <p align="left">Wasting so much good material on inner dialogue this weekend - time to get
   some of it down. I am in a new place at the moment. Usually when I go off on a
   self hate binge I get all depressed - this time is different - I feel detached somehow.
    A cold rage at my inadequacy. All mouth and no trousers. I go on and on
   about how no-one loves me - but can I really be surprised? I am a total loser.
    I can't get over this fear of doing something wrong. I know on a theoretical
   level that nothing lasting can happen if I do something wrong - yet the fear is there.
    My fear of saying or doing something wrong leads me to say and do nothing just to
   be on the safe side. I am pathetic. Why do I do it? What am I afraid of?
    Is it rejection? I've been rejected before, and I know it only hurts for a
   while - nothing permanent. Is it because I don't want to impose? That could
   explain why I can say things online that I would never say in person - if I put something
   up here that no-one wants to read, then they just don't read it. If I'm saying
   something in person then it's only polite to stick it out. People will generally
   tend to pretend that it isn't an imposition rather than cause hurt feelings. I only
   want to speak if the other person wants to listen - I find it hard to believe that anyone
   would though. �, en �murlegt. Apparently that means &quot;Oh, how
   pathetic&quot;, but in a sympathetic way. Cool language - gotta dig any language
   which can tell you you're pathetic while showing empathy. I wonder how babelfish
   would translate it? It doesn't translate Icelandic though, so no way to tell...
    The thought of eternal loneliness still causes me pain, but knowing that it is my
   fault rather than that of fate is oddly comforting. I am fucking weird. 
   Bigtime yo-yoing of my insides at the moment. Up then down. 
   Topsy-turvey. I wish I was someone else. I guess someone's got to be me
   though, and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else. I just hope that if there
   is someone up there watching I am giving him a chance to get a good belly laugh in at my
   expense. Laugh it up beardy boy - I won't last forever, then you'll have to
   find some other pathetic sap to pick on. Somebody shoot me - I haven't got the guts
   to do it myself. Forever lays before me. I guess I take it one step at a
   time... Curling up in a ball and wanting to die doesn't help though. It's
   passed some time over the weekend though... Didn't get dressed at all today - 
   only strayed downstairs a couple of times to get food. Most of the day in front of
   the TV. As usual. Lot's of online time while I've downloaded stuff. 
   No-one around to chat to though. Not that I'm even vaguely comparable to good
   company at the moment. It helps to rant at someone every now and then though. 
   I don't know if this is helping or not. Usually this helps me get the feelings out -
   to calm me. Today though it is just as bad as when I brood on this stuff
   internally. I wish I wasn't so obsessive. I wish I could just put the past
   behind me and move on. Learn from my mistakes and face tomorrow. The scary
   thing though is that even with all of the reconstruction I have done in my head over the
   past two days I still wouldn't do anything different if I had the time again. I
   don't know how to do things different. It's not in my nature. At least my line
   will end here and my genes will never be inflicted on future generations. Trying so
   hard to find the glass half full - but it ever remains half empty. God I wish I
   could just collapse into bed and sleep - I'm not tired though - spent too much time
   sleeping this weekend already. The thought of leaving the house fills me with dread.
    What right do I have to inflict myself on society when I'm so obviously
   dysfunctional. I'm like some bizarre semi-autistic freak. Someone new comes
   along and I just freeze up totally - go all inwards and say nothing. Open up
   eventually - to an extent anyway. But by that time the damage is done. It's
   not like I always say the wrong thing either - I do sometimes, but when I start I can
   generally keep on topic, and sometimes even be relevant or funny. But when I freeze
   I am lost - my mind goes empty and I can't find any thoughts to string together. OK,
   this is officially not helping. I'm gonna call it a night as far as the writing is
   concerned. G'Nite.</p>

08:28
^^^^^

Choked utterly. I'm going to be even more one-track than normal this morning. A
paraphrased quote hangs in my mind &quot;When I'm with a girl I like I find it
hard to say anything cool, or witty... Or at all. I can usually make a few
vowel sounds, then I have to go away&quot;. It's not even that there were words
there that I couldn't get out - my mind just went totally empty. I am going to
be alone forever and I deserve it because I am such a pathetic fuckwit.

08:04
^^^^^

I am fucking hopeless. There is no hope for me. Totally choked. God. I feel ill
when I think back on it. How can I be such a fucking tit? I don't deserve to
live - somebody please shoot me. Waiting for five weeks and then barely say a
word all night.
