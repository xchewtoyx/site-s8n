08:24 - Backlog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Eek - I'm updating again. Well my backlog of comics is gone - so I need
something to fill the void again. Boy will I be glad when June gets here. The
main reason is obvious - Charlotte arrives ::grin:: there's another reason
though - no timezones will mean earlier nights and more sleep and it won't be
so bloody difficult to get up in the morning any more. I should start getting
up earlier and getting the 7:30 train - but at the minute I'm just too tired
every morning. At the weekends all I do is catch up on sleep. Timeout - train
to catch. Superpowers would be nice. The Flash's speed for example - get up at
5 to 9 get dressed - run to work - arrive 4 mins 58 secs before 9. An emptiness
inside me. An emptiness beside me. But so much less than the emptiness before.
Only 8 weeks until the emptiness goes - never to return. I wonder how I will
update this entry. At some point I should move my domain off of NT - I was
going to get my own server and move it onto that. I have other expenses to
think of first though.
