Wow, over a month between updates... And what a month :) I've met my baby. I
flew half way around the world to meet Charlotte and she was everything I
thought she would be and more. The wedding is in November ::grin:: Yup, that's
right - we're gonna be getting married ::uncontrolable stupid grin:: I have
:doc:`piccies<../gallery/index>` from when I was there...  I don't really know
what else to say at the moment except that I am a very happy chappy... And that
I should be getting back to work, so I'll end this rant now :)
