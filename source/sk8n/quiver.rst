My current board count is 5.  This page will give pictures of my boards,
and will also give mini reviews when I get around to it.

The deck I rode in the mid 80s when I was a kid.  Covered in stickers so
the original graphic is not visible.  I think it was from Argos.

Pictured here with no trucks, but currently set up with deadbolts trucks,
generic bearings, no-name 65mm wheels, a black tail-bone and fetching pink
plastic rails.

Standard symmetrical shaped 7-ply maple shortboard. Green banzai graphic
augmented by my son with some Power Rangers stickers.

Set up with Independant 129 trucks, no-name ceramic bearings and Spitfire
57mm wheels.

46" pintail.  9-ply maple.  Currently set up with 9" conventional trucks
that came as part of the complete.  Khiro soft angled risers (approx 7
degrees). Kryptonics Hawiaii Orange Swirl wheels.  Generic 608-2RS
bearings.

The first longboard I bought.  A bit flexy for my weight, but it's served
me well.  The trucks don't turn that well, but with a bit of angle they do
the job.

I'm currently running this as my wet weather board.  The bearings are 
lubed with a heavy waterproof grease meant for boat trailer bearings, they
don't spin that quick, but I can do some riding in very wet conditions
without having to worry about them rusting up.

My main dry weather board.

Kisiwa #318: 12 plys of baltic birch hand shaped in the UK by Tom to a
sweet 60"x11.5" board with full length concave a touch of camber and a
functional kicktail.  This board is beautiful.

I have this board set up with Holey trucks, Lush swiss speed bearings,
Abec 11 Gumball 78a wheels and 1/4" of soft riser.

You get some funny looks when you're getting onto a busy commuter train
carrying a 5-foot board; but who cares about funny looks when you have a ride
this smooth?  The big Gumball wheels coupled with a touch of flex in the
board soak up all the inconsistencies in the road.

I can't ride this board as it's supposed to be ridden, I spend most of my
time static up near the nose, rather than cross stepping along the length.
Board walking balance is right up there in my priorities for things to
work on; it'll be a long time before I'm up to Adam Colton's trick tips
at http://www.longboardlarry.net/ though ;).

Lush Globe 38

Longer than average for a slide board, but I prefer the extra length.
This board is as short as I'd want to go for skogging; as it is I sometimes
go into an accidental wheelie while riding.

Lush push the Globe series as being able to do anything.  I won't disagree,
but the focus on these boards is definitely more on sliding than bombing.
I like this board; I haven't pushed it anywhere near as hard as it's
supposed to be pushed but riding it makes me want to :)

I have this set up with Indy 169s, Rainskate Tsunami 95a wheels and Lush
Swiss bearings.

The Indy's don't turn too sharp, so it's not really a carver.  I'm
considering trying some wedge to fix that, but I'm happy with the way it is
at the moment.  It's not used much for the commuter run due to the hard
wheels, but when I do run it I certainly enjoy it:)  Should get more use
in the summer as the evenings get lighter.
