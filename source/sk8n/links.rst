Riding Styles
-------------

* Skogging_ 

  New schoolers may not like pushing mongo, but why limit yourself to one
  stance?  Chris Yandall is the ultimate resource on Skogging.  I've lost
  a lot of weight through doing this and had a lot of fun in the process :).

* Skumping_

  Skogging is long distance balanced pushing; with Skumping you can
  travel the same distances without ever touching the ground.  Hard work,
  looks...  ok, it looks pretty silly, but the sense of achievment when you
  manage to cover the distance is amazing. (I'm only managing 1/2 mile
  skumps at most and that leaves me pretty stoked; can't imagine how the
  guys managing marathon distances are feeling).

* `Surface Motion Skate`_

  Techniques for riding big boards.  Everything from how to drop knee turn
  to ollieing a 5 footer.  Essential site if you skate more than 40".

* Dancing_

  Watch the videos and gape in awe.  That's all I have to say.
