sk8n shoes
==========

I was recently involved in a discussion at silverfish suggesting that it would be nice to get a sole shaped piece of Abec 11 Urethane to regrip shoes that are worn from foot breaking. The idea was generally shot down by the posters, but I still think it's a good idea, so I'm going to try it out using materials purchased from an online shoe manufacture supplier. As a control I am also going to test one of the other methods suggested. The Chaput Method.

Method one: The Chaput method
-----------------------------

Love him or loathe him, Chris Chaput is fast (and makes exceedingly good wheels). He has been known to joke that his speed is due to his ultra aerodynamic slip on shoes that he buys at incredibly cheap prices.

So to test this method of Shoe economy I have bought myself a pair of the cheapest shoes I could find.

A lovely pair of white trainers exclusively from George of Asda for Â£7. Cryptically labelled as being made from "Other materials" they have a foam base with a thin rubber or urethane layer with a simple zig-zag grip pattern. They're quite comfortable, but don't feel too sturdy. I am going to use them for a week then see how the sole is standing up to the regular footbreaking load of my daily commute.
